Weights determine the strength of the connections between neurons, while biases allow neurons to learn different patterns in the data.\\n\\n4. Activation functions: Activation functions introduce nonlinearity into artificial neural networks, allowing them to learn complex patterns in the data. Common activation functions include sigmoid, tanh, ReLU, and softmax.\\n\\n5. Backpropagation: Backpropagation is a key algorithm used to train artificial neural networks. It involves calculating the gradient of the loss function with respect to the weights and biases, and then updating them using an optimization algorithm such as stochastic gradient descent.
