Increased\\ncapabilit y in this respect is tak en to mean a mixture of the following: more-r apid comprehension, better\\ncomprehension, the possibilit y of gaining a useful degree of comprehension in a situation that previously w as too\\ncomplex, speedier solutions, better solutions, and the possibilit y of finding solutions to problems that before\\nseemed insoluble. And b y \"complex situations\" we include the professional problems of diplomats, ex ecutiv es,\\nsocial scientists, life scientists, ph ysical scientists, attorneys, designers— whether the problem situation exists for\\ntwent y minutes or twent y years. W e do not speak of isolated clev er tricks that help in particular situations. W e\\nrefer to a w ay of life in an integr ated domain where hunches, cut -and-try , intangibles, and the human \"feel for a\\nsituation\" usefully co-exist with powerful concepts, streamlined terminology and notation, sophisticated methods,\\nand high-powered electronic aids. 1a1\\nMan\\'s population and gross product are increasing at a consider able r ate, but the complexity  of his problems\\ngrows still faster , and the urgency  with which solutions must be found becomes steadily greater in response to\\nthe increased r ate of activit y and the increasingly global nature of that activit y. Augmenting man\\'s intellect, in\\nthe sense defined abo ve, would w arrant full pursuit b y an enlightened societ y if there could be shown a\\nreasonable approach and some plausible benefits. 1a2\\nThis report co vers the first phase of a progr am aimed at dev eloping means to augment the human intellect.\\nThese \"means\" can include man y things— all of which appear to be but extensions of means dev eloped and used\\nin the past to help man apply his nativ e sensory , mental, and motor capabilities— and we consider the whole\\nsystem of a human and his augmentation means as a proper field of search for pr actical possibilities. It is a v ery\\nimportant system to our societ y, and lik e most systems its performance can best be impro ved by considering the\\nwhole as a set of inter acting components r ather than b y considering the components in isolation. 1a3\\nThis kind of system approach to human intellectual effectiv eness does not find a ready -made conceptual\\nframework such as exists for established disciplines. Before a research progr am can be designed to pursue such\\nan approach intelligently , so that pr actical benefits might be deriv ed within a reasonable time while also\\nproducing results of longr ange significance, a conceptual fr amework must be searched out —a framework that\\nprovides orientation as to the important factors of the system, the relationships among these factors, the t ypes\\nof change among the system factors that offer lik ely impro vements in performance, and the sort of research\\ngoals and methodology that seem promising.*1* 1a4\\nIn the first (search) phase of our progr am we ha ve dev eloped a conceptual fr amework that seems satisfactory\\nfor the current needs of designing a research phase. Section II  contains the essence of this fr amework as\\nderived from sev eral different w ays of looking at the system made up of a human and his intellect -augmentation\\nmeans. 1a5', metadata={'source': './assets-resources/Augmenting-Human-Intellect_ A-Conceptual-Framework-1962-Doug Engelbart.pdf', 'page': 1}),\n",

Consequently ,\\nSection III  is intended to present some definite images that illustr ate meaningful possibilities deriv eable from the\\nconceptual fr amework presented in Section II —and in a r ather mark ed deviation from ordinary technical writing,\\na good portion of Section III  presents these images in a fiction-dialogue st yle as a mechanism for tr ansmitting a\\nfeeling for the richness and promise of the possibilities in one region of the impro vement space\" that is roughly\\nmapped in Section II . 1a7\\nThe st yle of Section III  seems to mak e for easier reading. If Section II  begins to seem unrew ardingly difficult,\\nthe reader ma y find it helpful to skip from Section II -B directly to Section III . If it serv es its purpose well\\nenough, Section III  will pro vide a context within which the reader can go back and finish Section II  with less\\neffort. 1a8\\nIn Section IV  (Research R ecommendations) we present a gener al strategy for pursuing research tow ard\\nincreasing human intellectual effectiv eness. This str ategy ev olved directly from the concepts presented in\\nSections II and III; one of its important precepts is to pursue the quick est gains first, and use the increased\\nintellectual effectiv eness thus deriv ed to help pursue successiv e gains. W e see the quick est gains emerging from\\n(1) giving the human the minute-b y-minute services of a digital computer equipped with computer -driven\\ncathode-r ay-tube displa y, and (2) dev eloping the new methods of thinking and working that allow the human to\\ncapitaliz e upon the computer\\'s help . By this same str ategy , we recommend that an initial research effort dev elop\\na protot ype system of this sort aimed at increasing human effectiv eness in the task of computer progr amming. 1a9\\nTo give the reader an initial orientation about what sort of thing this computer -aided working system might be,\\nwe include below a short description of a possible system of this sort. This illustr ative example is not to be\\nconsidered a description of the actual system that will emerge from the progr am. It is giv en only to show the\\ngener al direction of the work, and is clothed in fiction only to mak e it easier to visualiz e. 1a10', metadata={'source': './assets-resources/Augmenting-Human-Intellect_ A-Conceptual-Framework-1962-Doug Engelbart.pdf', 'page': 2}),\n",

He sits at a working station that has a visual displa y screen\\nsome three feet on a side; this is his working surface, and is controlled b y a computer (his \"clerk\") with which he\\ncan communicate b y means of a small k eyboard and v arious other devices. 1a11\\nHe is designing a building. He has already dreamed up sev eral basic la youts and structur al forms, and is trying\\nthem out on the screen. The surv eying data for the la yout he is working on now ha ve already been entered, and\\nhe has just coax ed the clerk to show him a perspectiv e view of the steep hillside building site with the roadw ay\\nabove, symbolic representations of the v arious trees that are to remain on the lot, and the service tie points for\\nthe different utilities. The view occupies the left two-thirds of the screen. With a \"pointer ,\" he indicates two\\npoints of interest, mo ves his left hand r apidly o ver the k eyboard, and the distance and elev ation between the\\npoints indicated appear on the right -hand third of the screen. 1a12\\nNow he enters a reference line with his pointer , and the k eyboard. Gr adually the screen begins to show the work\\nhe is doing— a neat ex cavation appears in the hillside) revises itself slightly , and revises itself again. After a\\nmoment, the architect changes the scene on the screen to an o verhead plan view of the site, still showing the\\nexcavation. A few minutes of study , and he enters on the k eyboard a list of items, checking each one as it\\nappears on the screen, to be studied later . 1a13\\nIgnoring the representation on the displa y, the architect next begins to enter a series of specifications and data—\\na six-inch slab floor , twelv e-inch concrete w alls eight feet high within the ex cavation, and so on. When he has\\nfinished, the revised scene appears on the screen. A structure is taking shape. He examines it, adjusts it, pauses\\nlong enough to ask for handbook or catalog information from the clerk at v arious points, and readjusts\\naccordingly . He often recalls from the \"clerk\" his working lists of specifications and consider ations to refer to\\nthem, modif y them, or add to them. These lists grow into an ev ermore-detailed, interlink ed structure, which\\nrepresents the maturing thought behind the actual design. 1a14\\nPrescribing different planes here and there, curv ed surfaces occasionally , and mo ving the whole structure about\\nfive feet, he finally has the rough external form of the building balanced nicely with the setting and he is assured\\nthat this form is basically compatible with the materials to be used as well as with the function of the building. 1a15\\nNow he begins to enter detailed information about the interior . Here the capabilit y of the clerk to show him an y\\nview he w ants to examine (a slice of the interior , or how the structure would look from the roadw ay abo ve) is\\nimportant. He enters particular fixture designs, and examines them in a particular room. He checks to mak e sure\\nthat sun glare from the windows will not blind a driv er on the roadw ay, and the \"clerk\" computes the information\\nthat one window will reflect strongly onto the roadw ay between 6 and 6:30 on midsummer mornings. 1a16\\nNext he begins a functional analysis. He has a list of the people who will occup y this building, and the daily\\nsequences of their activities.

Finally he has the \"clerk\" combine all of these sequences of activit y to indicate\\nspots where tr affic is hea vy in the building, or where congestion might occur , and to determine what the sev erest\\ndrain on the utilities is lik ely to be. 1a17\\nAll of this information (the building design and its associated \"thought structure\") can be stored on a tape to\\nrepresent the design manual for the building.

First, although a conceptual fr amework has been constructed, it is still\\nrudimentary . Further search, and actual research, are needed for the ev olution of the fr amework. Second, ev en if\\nour conceptual fr amework did pro vide an accur ate and complete basic analysis of the system from which stems a\\nhuman's intellectual effectiv eness, the explicit nature of future impro ved systems would be highly affected b y\\n(expected) changes in our technology or in our understanding of the human being. 1b2\\n2 II. CONCEPTU AL FRAMEWORK\\nA. GENERAL 2a\\nThe conceptual fr amework we seek must orient us tow ard the real possibilities and problems associated with\\nusing modern technology to giv e direct aid to an individual in comprehending complex situations, isolating the\\nsignificant factors, and solving problems. T o gain this orientation, we examine how individuals achiev e their\\npresent lev el of effectiv eness, and expect that this examination will rev eal possibilities for impro vement. 2a1\\nThe entire effect of an individual on the world stems essentially from what he can tr ansmit to the world through\\nhis limited motor channels. This in turn is based on information receiv ed from the outside world through limited\\nsensory channels; on information, driv es, and needs gener ated within him; and on his processing of that\\ninformation. His processing is of two kinds: that which he is gener ally conscious of (recognizing patterns,\\nremembering, visualizing, abstr acting, deducing, inducing, etc.), and that in volving the unconscious processing\\nand mediating of receiv ed and self -gener ated information, and the unconscious mediating of conscious\\nprocessing itself . 2a2\\nThe individual does not use this information and this processing to gr apple directly with the sort of complex\\nsituation in which we seek to giv e him help . He uses his innate capabilities in a r ather more indirect fashion,\\nsince the situation is gener ally too complex to yield directly to his motor actions, and alw ays too complex to yield\\ncomprehensions and solutions from direct sensory inspection and use of basic cognitiv e capabilities. F or instance,\\nan aborigine who possesses all of our basic sensory -mental-motor capabilities, but does not possess our\\nbackground of indirect knowledge and procedure, cannot organiz e the proper direct actions necessary to driv e a\\ncar through tr affic, request a book from the libr ary, call a committee meeting to discuss a tentativ e plan, call\\nsomeone on the telephone, or compose a letter on the t ypewriter . 2a3\\nOur culture has ev olved means for us to organiz e the little things we can do with our basic capabilities so that we\\ncan deriv e comprehension from truly complex situations, and accomplish the processes of deriving and\\nimplementing problem solutions. The w ays in which human capabilities are thus extended are here called\\naugmentation means , and we define four basic classes of them: 2a4\", metadata={'source': './assets-resources/Augmenting-Human-Intellect_ A-Conceptual-Framework-1962-Doug Engelbart.pdf', 'page': 5}),\n",

Artifacts —physical objects designed to pro vide for human comfort, for the manipulation of things or\\nmaterials, and for the manipulation of symbols. 2a4a\\n2. Language —the w ay in which the individual parcels out the picture of his world into the concepts that\\nhis mind uses to model that world, and the symbols that he attaches to those concepts and uses in\\nconsciously manipulating the concepts (\"thinking\"). 2a4b\\n3. Methodology —the methods, procedures, str ategies, etc. , with which an individual organiz es his goal-\\ncentered  (problem-solving) activit y. 2a4c\\n4. Training —the conditioning needed b y the human being to bring his skills in using Means 1, 2, and 3 to\\nthe point where they are oper ationally effectiv e. 2a4d\\nThe system we w ant to impro ve can thus be visualiz ed as a tr ained human being together with his artifacts,\\nlanguage, and methodology . The explicit new system we contemplate will in volve as artifacts computers, and\\ncomputer -controlled information-stor age, information-handling, and information-displa y devices. The aspects of\\nthe conceptual fr amework that are discussed here are primarily those relating to the human being\\'s abilit y to\\nmake significant use of such equipment in an integr ated system. 2a5\\nPervading all of the augmentation means is a particular structure or organization. While an untr ained aborigine\\ncannot driv e a car through tr affic, because he cannot leap the gap between his cultur al background and the kind\\nof world that contains cars and tr affic, it is possible to mo ve step b y step through an organiz ed training progr am\\nthat will enable him to driv e effectiv ely and safely . In other words, the human mind neither learns nor acts b y\\nlarge leaps, but b y steps organiz ed or structured so that each one depends upon previous steps. 2a6\\nAlthough the siz e of the step a human being can tak e in comprehension, inno vation, or ex ecution is small in\\ncomparison to the o ver-all siz e of the step needed to solv e a complex problem, human beings nev ertheless do\\nsolve complex problems. It is the augmentation means that serv e to break down a large problem in such a w ay\\nthat the human being can w alk through it with his little steps, and it is the structure or organization of these\\nlittle steps or actions that we discuss as process hierarchies . 2a7\\nEvery process of thought or action is made up of sub-processes. Let us consider such examples as making a\\npencil strok e, writing a letter of the alphabet, or making a plan. Quite a few discrete muscle mo vements are\\norganiz ed into the making of a pencil strok e; similarly , making particular pencil strok es and making a plan for a\\nletter are complex processes in themselv es that become sub-processes to the o ver-all writing of an alphabetic\\ncharacter. 2a8', metadata={'source': './assets-resources/Augmenting-Human-Intellect_ A-Conceptual-Framework-1962-Doug Engelbart.pdf', 'page': 6}),\n",

There seems to be no\\nway of telling whether or not the apparent bottoms (processes that cannot be further subdivided) exist in the\\nphysical world or in the limitations of human understanding. 2a9\\nIn any case, it is not necessary to begin from the bottom in discussing particular process hier archies. No person\\nuses a process that is completely unique ev ery time he tackles something new . Instead, he begins from a group\\nof basic sensory -mental-motor process capabilities, and adds to these certain of the process capabilities of his\\nartifacts. There are only a finite number of such basic human and artifact capabilities from which to dr aw.\\nFurthermore, ev en quite different higher order processes ma y have in common relativ ely high-order sub-\\nprocesses.\" 2a10\\nWhen a man writes prose text (a reasonably high-order process), he mak es use of man y processes as sub-\\nprocesses that are common to other high-order processes. F or example, he mak es use of planning, composing,\\ndictating. The process of writing is utiliz ed as a sub-process within man y different processes of a still higher\\norder, such as organizing a committee, changing a policy , and so on. 2a11\\nWhat happens, then, is that each individual dev elops a certain repertoire of process capabilities from which he\\nselects and adapts those that will compose the processes that he ex ecutes. This repertoire is lik e a tool kit, and\\njust as the mechanic must know what his tools can do and how to use them, so the intellectual work er must\\nknow the capabilities of his tools and ha ve good methods, str ategies, and rules of thumb for making use of\\nthem. All of the process capabilities in the individual\\'s repertoire rest ultimately upon basic capabilities within\\nhim or his artifacts, and the entire repertoire represents an inter -knit, hier archical structure (which we often call\\nthe repertoire hierarchy ). 2a12\\nWe find three gener al categories of process capabilities within a t ypical individual\\'s repertoire. There are those\\nthat are ex ecuted completely within the human integument, which we call explicit-human  process capabilities;\\nthere are those possessed b y artifacts for ex ecuting processes without human interv ention, which we call\\nexplicit-artifact  process capabilities; and there are what we call the composite  process capabilities, which are\\nderived from hier archies containing both of the other kinds. 2a13\\nWe assume that it is our H-LAM/T system  (Human using Language, Artifacts, Methodology , in which he is\\nTrained) that has the capabilit y and that performs the process in an y instance of use of this repertoire. Let us\\nlook within the process structure for the LAM/T ingredients, to get a better \"feel\" for our models. Consider the\\nprocess of writing an important memo . There is a particular concept associated with this process—that of putting\\ninformation into a formal package and distributing it to a set of people for a certain kind of consider ation— and\\nthe type of information package associated with this concept has been giv en the special name of memorandum .\\nAlready the system language shows the effect of this process—i.e. , a concept and its name. 2a14', metadata={'source': './assets-resources/Augmenting-Human-Intellect_ A-Conceptual-Framework-1962-Doug Engelbart.pdf', 'page': 7}),\n",

There is a definite w ay in which these sub-processes will be organiz ed that represents part of the\\nsystem methodology . Each of these sub-processes represents a functional concept that must be a part of the\\nsystem language if it is to be organiz ed effectiv ely into the human's w ay of doing things, and the symbolic\\nportrayal of each concept must be such that the human can work with it and remember it. 2a15\\nIf the memo is simple, a par agraph or so in length, then the first three processes ma y well be of the explicit -\\nhuman t ype (i.e. , it ma y be planned, dev eloped) and composed within the mind) and the last two of the\\ncomposite t ype. If it is a complex memo , involving a good deal of careful planning and dev elopment, then all of\\nthe sub-processes might well be of the composite t ype (e.g. , at least including the use of pencil and paper\\nartifacts)' and there might be man y different applications of some of the process capabilities within the total\\nprocess (i.e. , successiv e drafts, revised plans). 2a16\\nThe set of sub-process capabilities discussed so far , if called upon in proper occasion and sequence, would indeed\\nenable the ex ecution of the memo- writing process. Howev er, the v ery process of organizing and supervising the\\nutilization of these sub-process capabilities is itself a most important sub-process of the memo- writing process.\\nHence, the sub-process capabilities as listed would not be complete without the addition of a sev enth capabilit y—\\nwhat we call the executive  capabilit y. This is the capabilit y stemming from habit, str ategy , rules of thumb ,\\nprejudice, learned method, intuition, unconscious dictates, or combinations thereof , to call upon the appropriate\\nsub-process capabilities with a particular sequence and timing. An ex ecutiv e process (i.e. , the ex ercise of an\\nexecutiv e capabilit y) involves such sub-processes as planning, selecting, and supervising, and it is really the\\nexecutiv e processes that embody all of the methodology in the H-LAM/T system. 2a17\\nTo illustr ate the capabilit y-hierarchy features of our conceptual fr amework, let us consider an artifact inno vation\\nappearing directly within the relativ ely low -order capabilit y for composing and modif ying written text, and see\\nhow this can affect a (or , for instance, y our) hier archy of capabilities. Suppose y ou had a new writing machine—\\nthink of it as a high-speed electric t ypewriter with some special features. Y ou could oper ate its k eyboard to cause\\nit to write text much as y ou could use a con ventional t ypewriter .

THE BASIC PERSPECTIVE 2b\\nIndividuals who oper ate effectiv ely in our culture ha ve already been consider ably \"augmented.\" Basic human\\ncapabilities for sensing stimuli, performing numerous mental oper ations, and for communicating with the outside\\nworld, are put to work in our societ y within a system— an H-LAM/T system—the individual augmented b y the\\nlanguage, artifacts, and methodology in which he is tr ained. Furthermore, we suspect that impro ving the\\neffectiv eness of the individual as he oper ates in our societ y should be approached as a system-engineering\\nproblem—that is, the H-LAM/T system should be studied as an inter acting whole from a synthesis-oriented\\napproach. 2b1\\nThis view of the system as an inter acting whole is strongly bolstered b y considering the repertoire hier archy of\\nprocess capabilities that is structured from the basic ingredients within the H-LAM/T system. The realization that\\nany potential change in language, artifact, or methodology has importance only relativ e to its use within a\\nprocess\\' and that a new process capabilit y appearing an ywhere within that hier archy can mak e practical a new\\nconsider ation of latent change possibilities in man y other parts of the hier archy—possibilities in either language,\\nartifacts, or methodology —brings out the strong interrelationship of these three augmentation means. 2b2\\nIncreasing the effectiv eness of the individual\\'s use of his basic capabilities is a problem in redesigning the\\nchangeable parts of a system. The system is activ ely engaged in the continuous processes (among others) of\\ndeveloping comprehension within the individual and of solving problems; both processes are subject to human\\nmotiv ation, purpose, and will. T o redesign the system\\'s capabilit y for performing these processes means\\nredesigning all or part of the repertoire hier archy. To redesign a structure, we must learn as much as we can of\\nwhat is known about the basic materials and components as they are utiliz ed within the structure; bey ond that,\\nwe must learn how to view , to measure, to analyz e, and to ev aluate in terms of the functional whole and its\\npurpose. In this particular case, no existing analytic theory is b y itself adequate for the purpose of analyzing and\\nevaluating o ver-all system performance; pursuit of an impro ved system thus demands the use of experimental\\nmethods. 2b3\\nIt need not be just the v ery sophisticated or formal process capabilities that are added or modified in this\\nredesign. Essentially an y of the processes utiliz ed by a representativ e human toda y—the processes that he\\nthinks of when he looks ahead to his da y\\'s work —are composite processes of the sort that in volve external\\ncomposing and manipulating of symbols (text, sk etches, diagr ams, lists, etc.).

Concepts, Symbols, and a Hypothesis 2c4\\nBefore we pursue further direct discussion of the H-LAM/T system, let us examine some background material.\\nConsider the following historical progression in the dev elopment of our intellectual capabilities: 2c4a\\n(1) Concept Manipulation —Humans rose abo ve the lower forms of life b y evolving the biological\\ncapabilit y for dev eloping abstr actions and concepts. They could manipulate these concepts within their\\nminds to a certain extent, and think about situations in the abstr act. Their mental capabilities allowed them\\nto dev elop gener al concepts from specific instances, predict specific instances from gener al concepts,\\nassociate concepts, remember them, etc. W e speak here of concepts in their r aw, unverbaliz ed form. F or\\nexample, a person letting a door swing shut behind him suddenly visualiz es the person who follows him\\ncarrying a cup of hot coffee and some sticky pastries. Of all the aspects of the pending ev ent, the spilling of\\nthe coffee and the squashing of the pastry somehow are abstr acted immediately , and associated with a\\nconcept of personal responsibilit y and a dislik e for these consequences. But a solution comes to mind\\nimmediately as an image of a quick stop and an arm stab back tow ard the door , with motion and timing\\nthat could prev ent the collision, and the solution is accepted and enacted. With only non-symbolic concept\\nmanipulation, we could probably build primitiv e shelter , evolve strategies of w ar and hunt, pla y games, and\\nmake practical jok es. But further powers of intellectual effectiv eness are implicit in this stage of biological\\nevolution (the same stage we are in toda y). 2c4a1\\n(2) Symbol Manipulation —Humans made another great step forw ard when they learned to represent\\nparticular concepts in their minds with specific symbols. Here we tempor arily disregard communicativ e\\nspeech and writing, and consider only the direct v alue to the individual  of being able to do his hea vy\\nthinking b y mentally manipulating symbols instead of the more un wieldly concepts which they represent.\\nConsider , for instance, the mental difficult y involved in herding twent y-seven sheep if , instead of\\nremembering one cardinal number and occasionally counting, we had to remember what each sheep\\nlooked lik e, so that if the flock seemed too small we could visualiz e each one and check whether or not it\\nwas there. 2c4a2\\n(3) Manual, External, Symbol Manipulation —Another significant step tow ard harnessing the\\nbiologically ev olved mental capabilities in pursuit of comprehension and problem solutions came with the\\ndevelopment of the means for externalizing some of the symbol-manipulation activit y, particularly in\\ngraphical representation. This supplemented the individual's memory and abilit y to visualiz e.

W e speak of the manual means of making gr aphical\\nrepresentations of symbols— a stick and sand, pencil and paper and er aser, straight edge or compass, and\\nso on.) It is principally this kind of means for external symbol manipulation that has been associated with\\nthe ev olution of the individual\\'s present w ay of doing his concept manipulation (thinking). 2c4a3\\nIt is undoubtedly true that concepts which people found useful ended up being symboliz ed in their language,\\nand hence that the ev olution of language w as affected b y the concepts the people dev eloped and used.\\nHowev er, Korzybski[4] and Whorf[5] (among others) ha ve argued that the language we use affects our\\nthinking to a consider able extent. They sa y that a lack of words for some t ypes of concepts mak es it hard to\\nexpress those concepts, and thus decreases the lik elihood that we will learn much about them. If this is so ,\\nthen once a language has begun to grow and be used, it would seem reasonable to suspect that the language\\nalso affects the ev olution of the new concepts to be expressed in that language. 2c4b\\nApparently there are counter -arguments to this; e.g. , if a concept needs to be used often but its expression is\\ndifficult, then the language will ev olve to ease the situation. Howev er, the studies of the past decade into what\\nare called \"self -organizing\" systems seem to be rev ealing that subtle relationships among its inter acting\\nelements can significantly influence the course of ev olution of such a system. If this is true, and if language is\\n(as it seems to be) a part of a self -organizing system, then it seems probable that the state of a language at a\\ngiven time strongly affects its own ev olution to a succeeding state. 2c4c\\nFor our conceptual fr amework, we tend to fa vor the view that a language does ex ert a force in its own\\nevolution. W e observ e that the shift o ver the last few centuries in matters that are of daily concern to the\\nindividual has necessarily been forced into the fr amework of the language existing at the time, with\\nalterations gener ally limited to new uses for old words, or the coining of new words. The English language\\nsince Shak espeare has undergone no alter ation compar able to the alter ation in the cultur al environment; if it\\nhad, Shak espeare would no longer be accessible to us. Under such ev olutionary conditions, it would seem\\nunlikely that the language we now use pro vides the best possible service to our minds in pursuing\\ncomprehension and solving problems. It seems v ery lik ely that a more useful language form can be devised.\\n2c4d\\nThe Whorfian h ypothesis states that \"the world view of a culture is limited b y the structure of the language\\nwhich that culture uses.\" But there seems to be another factor to consider in the ev olution of language and\\nhuman reasoning abilit y. We offer the following h ypothesis, which is related to the Whorfian h ypothesis: Both\\nthe language used b y a culture, and the capabilit y for effectiv e intellectual activit y are directly affected during\\ntheir ev olution b y the means b y which individuals control the external manipulation of symbols.

F or the sak e of discussion, let us assume the Neo-\\nWhorfian h ypothesis to be true, and see what relev ant deductions can be made. 2c4f\\nIf the means ev olved for an individual's external manipulation of his thinking- aid symbols indeed directly\\naffect the w ay in which he thinks, then the original Whorfian h ypothesis would offer an added effect. The\\ndirect effect of the external-symbol-manipulation means upon language would produce an indirect effect upon\\nthe w ay of thinking via the Whorfian-h ypothesis linkage.

Experimental Results of Tying a Brick to a Pen cil to \"De-Augment\" the Individual.2c4l1\\nTo reflect further upon the implications of this h ypothesis, the following h ypothetical artifact dev elopment\\ncan be considered, representing a different t ype of external symbol manipulation that could ha ve had\\nconsider able effect. Suppose that our y oung technology of a few gener ations ago had dev eloped an artifact\\nthat w as essentially a high speed, semi- automatic table-lookup device—cheap enough for almost ev eryone to\\nafford and small and light enough to be carried on the person. Assume that the individual cartridges sold b y\\nmanufacturers (publishers) contained the look -up information, that one cartridge could hold the equiv alent of\\nan unabridged dictionary , and that a one-par agraph definition could alw ays be located and displa yed on the\\nface of the device b y the a verage pr acticed individual in less than three seconds. The fortunes of technological\\ninvention, commercial interest, and public acceptance just might ha ve evolved something lik e this. 2c4m\\nIf it were so v ery easy to look things up , how would our v ocabulary dev elop, how would our habits of\\nexploring the intellectual domains of others shift, how might the sophistication of pr actical organization\\nmature (if each person can so quickly and easily look up applicable rules), how would our education system\\nchange to tak e adv antage of this new external symbol-manipulation capabilit y of students and teachers (and\\nadministr ators)? 2c4n\\nThe significance to our study of the discussion in this section lies in the perspectiv e it giv es to the w ays in\\nwhich human intellectual effectiv eness can be affected b y the particular means used b y individuals for their\\nexternal symbol manipulation. It seems reasonable to consider the dev elopment of automated external\\nsymbol manipulation means as a next stage in the ev olution of our intellectual power . 2c4o\\n5. Capability Repertoire Hierarchy 2c5\\nThe concept of our H-LAM/T system possessing a repertoire of capabilities that is structured in the form of a\\nhierarchy is most useful in our study . We shall use it in the following to tie together a number of\\nconsider ations and concepts. There are two points of focus in considering the design of new repertoire\\nhierarchies: the materials with which we ha ve to work, and the principles b y which new capabilit y is\\nconstructed from these basic materials. 2c5a\\na.

Each such basic capabilit y represents a\\ntype of functional component with which the system can be built, and a thorough job of redesigning the\\nsystem calls for making an in ventory of the basic capabilities a vailable. Because we are exploring for\\nperspectiv e, and not y et recommending research activities, we are free to discuss and define in more detail\\nwhat we mean b y \"basic capabilit y\", without regard to the amount of research in volved in making an actual\\ninventory . 2c5b1\\nThe two domains, human and artifact, can be explored separ ately for their basic capabilities. In each we\\ncan isolate two classes of basic capabilit y; these classes are distinguished according to whether or not the\\ncapabilit y has been put to use within out augmentation means. The first class (those in use) can be found\\nin a methodical manner b y analyzing present capabilit y hier archies. F or example, select a giv en capabilit y,\\nat any level in the hier archy, and ask y ourself if it can be usefully changed b y any means that can be giv en\\nconsider ation in the augmentation research contemplated. If it can, then it is not basic but it can be\\ndecomposed into an ev entual set of basic capabilities. As y ou proceed down through the hier archy, you will\\nbegin to encounter capabilities that cannot be usefully changed, and these will mak e up y our in ventory of\\nbasic capabilities. Ultimately , every such recursiv e decomposition of a giv en capabilit y in the hier archy will\\nfind ev ery one of its br anching paths terminated b y basic capabilities. Beginning such decomposition search\\nwith different capabilities in the hier archy will ev entually unco ver all of those basic capabilities used within\\nthat hier archy or augmentation system. Man y of the br anching paths in the decomposition of a giv en\\nhigher -order capabilit y will terminate in the same basic capabilit y, since a giv en basic capabilit y will often\\nbe used within man y different higher -order capabilities. 2c5b2\\nDetermining the class of basic capabilities not already utiliz ed within existing augmentation systems\\nrequires a different explor ation method.

Similar\\ncapabilit y breakdowns will occur for sensory and cognitiv e capabilities. 2c5b5\\nb. Structure Types 2c5c\\n1) General 2c5c1\\nThe fundamental principle used in building sophisticated capabilities from the basic capabilities is\\nstructuring—the special t ype of structuring (which we ha ve termed synergetic) in which the organization\\nof a group of elements produces an effect greater than the mere addition of their individual effects.\\nPerhaps \"purposeful\" structuring (or organization) would serv e us as well, but since we aren\\'t sure y et\\nhow the structuring concept must mature for our needs, we shall tentativ ely stick with the special\\nmodifier , \"synergetic.\" W e are dev eloping a growing a wareness of the significant and perv asive nature of\\nsuch structure within ev ery ph ysical and conceptual thing we inspect, where the hier archical form seems\\nalmost univ ersally present as stemming from successiv e levels of such organization. 2c5c1a\\nThe fundamental entities that are being structured in each and ev ery case seems to be what we could\\ncall processes, where the most basic of ph ysical processes (in volving fields, charges, and momenta\\nassociated with the dynamics of fundamental particles) appear to be the hier archical base. There are\\ndynamic electro-optical-mechanical processes associated with the function of our artifacts (as well as\\nmetabolic, sensory , motor) and cognitiv e processes of the human, which we find to be relativ ely\\nfundamental components within the structure of our H-LAM/T system— and each of these seems truly to\\nbe ultimately based (to our degree of understanding) upon the abo ve mentioned basic ph ysical\\nprocesses. The elements that are organiz ed to giv e fixed structur al form to our ph ysical objects—e.g. ,\\nthe \"element\" of tensile strength of a material- are also deriv ed from what we could call synergetic\\nstructuring of the most basic ph ysical processes. 2c5c1b\\nBut at the lev el of the capabilit y hier archy where we wish to work, it seems useful to us to distinguish\\nseveral different t ypes of structuring—ev en though each t ype is fundamentally a structuring of the basic\\nphysical processes. T entativ ely we ha ve isolated fiv e such t ypes— although we are not sure how man y\\nwe shall ultimately w ant to use in considering the problem of augmenting the human intellect, nor how\\nwe might divide and subdivide these different manifestations of ph ysical-process structuring.

There is a term used in psy chology ,\\ncognitiv e structure, which so far seems to represent just what we w ant for our concept of mental\\nstructure, but we will not adopt it until we become more sure of what the accepted psy chological\\nmeaning is and of what we w ant for our conceptual fr amework. 2c5c2a\\nFor our present purpose, it is irrelev ant to worry o ver what the fundamental mental \"things\" being\\nstructured are, or what mechanisms are accomplishing the structuring or making use of what has been\\nstructured. W e feel reasonably safe in assuming that learning in volves some kind of meaningful\\norganization within the br ain, and that whatev er is so organiz ed or structured represents the oper ating\\nmodel of the individual\\'s univ erse to the mental mechanisms that deriv e his beha vior. And further , our\\nassumption is that when the human in our H/LAM system mak es the k ey decision or action that leads to\\nthe solution of a complex problem, it will stem from the state of his mental structure at that time. In\\nthis view then, the basic purpose of the system\\'s activit y on that problem up to that point has been to\\ndevelop his mental structure to the state from which the mental mechanisms could deriv e the k ey\\naction. 2c5c2b\\nOur school systems attest that there are specific experiences that can be giv en to a human that will\\nresult in dev elopment of his mental structure to the point where the beha vior deriv ed there from b y his\\nmental mechanisms shows us that he has gained new comprehension—in other words, we can do a\\ncertain amount from outside the human tow ard dev eloping his mental structure. Independent students\\nand researchers also attest that internally directed beha vior on the part of an individual can directly aid\\nhis structure-building process. 2c5c2c\\nWe don\\'t know whether a mental structure is dev eloped in a manner analogous to (a) dev elopment of a\\ngarden, where one pro vides a good en vironment, plants the seeds, k eeps competing weeds and\\ninjurious pests out, but otherwise has to let natur al processes tak e their course, or to (b) dev elopment\\nof a bask etball team, where much ex ercise of skills, patterns, and str ategies must be pro vided so that\\nnatur al processes can slowly knit together an integr ation, or to (c) dev elopment of a machine, where\\ncarefully formed elements are assembled in a precise, planned manner so that natur al phenomena can\\nimmediately yield planned function.

The gr asping and handling done b y these mechanisms can often be facilitated if the concept\\nis given an explicit \"handle\" in the form of a representativ e symbol. Somehow the mental mechanisms\\ncan learn to manipulate images (or something) of symbols in a meaningful w ay and remain calmly\\nconfident that the associated conceptual manipulations are within call. 2c5c3a\\nConcepts seem to be structur able, in that a new concept can be composed of an organization of\\nestablished concepts. F or present purposes, we can view a concept structure  as something which we\\nmight try to dev elop on paper for ourselv es or work with b y conscious thought processes, or as\\nsomething which we try to communicate to one another in serious discussion. W e assume that, for a\\ngiven unit of comprehension to be imparted, there is a concept structure (which can be consciously\\ndeveloped and displa yed) that can be presented to an individual in such a w ay that it is mapped into a\\ncorresponding mental structure which pro vides the basis for that individual\\'s \"comprehending\" beha vior.\\nOur working assumption also considers that some concept structures would be better for this purpose\\nthan others, in that they would be more easily mapped b y the individual into workable mental\\nstructures, or in that the resulting mental structures enable a higher degree of comprehension and\\nbetter solutions to problems, or both. 2c5c3b\\nA concept structure often grows as part of a cultur al evolution—either on a large scale within a large\\nsegment of societ y, or on a small scale within the activit y domain of an individual. But it is also\\nsomething that can be directly designed or modified, and a basic h ypothesis of our study is that better\\nconcept structures can be dev eloped—structures that when mapped into a human\\'s mental structure will\\nsignificantly impro ve his capabilit y to comprehend and to find solutions within his complex -problem\\nsituations. 2c5c3c', metadata={'source': './assets-resources/Augmenting-Human-Intellect_ A-Conceptual-Framework-1962-Doug Engelbart.pdf', 'page': 24}),\n",

Our concept of\\nlanguage as one of the basic means for augmenting the human intellect embr aces all of the concept\\nstructuring which the human ma y mak e use of . 2c5c3d\\n4) Symbol Structuring 2c5c4\\nThe other important part of our \"language\" is the w ay in which concepts are represented—the symbols\\nand symbol structures . Words structured into phr ases, sentences, par agraphs, monogr aphs—charts,\\nlists, diagr ams, tables, etc. A giv en structure of concepts can be represented b y any of an infinite\\nnumber of different symbol structures, some of which would be much better than others for enabling the\\nhuman perceptual and cognitiv e appar atus to search out and comprehend the conceptual matter of\\nsignificance and/or interest to the human. F or instance, a concept structure in volving man y numerical\\ndata would gener ally be much better represented with Ar abic r ather than R oman numer als and quite\\nlikely a gr aphic structure would be better than a tabular structure. 2c5c4a\\nBut it is not only the form of a symbol structure that is important. A problem solv er is in volved in a\\nstream of conceptual activit y whose course serv es his mental needs of the moment. The sequence and\\nnature of these needs are quite v ariable, and y et for each need he ma y benefit significantly from a form\\nof symbol structuring that is uniquely efficient for that need. 2c5c4b\\nTherefore, besides the forms of symbol structures that can be constructed and portr ayed, we are v ery\\nmuch concerned with the speed and flexibilit y with which one form can be tr ansformed into another , and\\nwith which new material can be located and portr ayed. 2c5c4c\\nWe are gener ally used to thinking of our symbol structures as a pattern of marks on a sheet of paper .\\nWhen we w ant a different symbol-structure view , we think of shifting our point of attention on the sheet,\\nor mo ving a new sheet into position. But another kind of view might be obtained b y extr acting and\\nordering all statements in the local text that bear upon consider ation A of the argument —or b y replacing\\nall occurrences of specified esoteric words b y one\\'s own definitions. This sort of \"view gener ation\"\\nbecomes quite feasible with a computer -controlled displa y system, and represents a v ery significant\\ncapabilit y to build upon. 2c5c4d\\nWith a computer manipulating our symbols and gener ating their portr ayals to us on a displa y, we no\\nlonger need think of our looking at the symbol structure which is stored— as we think of looking at the\\nsymbol structures stored in notebooks, memos, and books.

Whereas concept structuring and symbol structuring\\ntogether represent the language component of our augmentation means, process structuring represents\\nthe methodology component (plus a little more, actually). There has been enough previous discussion of\\nprocess structures that we need not describe the notion here, bey ond perhaps an example or two . The\\nindividual processes (or actions) of m y hands and fingers ha ve to be cooper atively organiz ed if the\\ntypewriter is to do m y bidding. My successiv e actions throughout m y working da y are meant to\\ncooper ate tow ard a certain o ver-all professional goal. 2c5c5b\\nMany of the process structures are applied to the task of organizing, ex ecuting, supervising, and\\nevaluating other process structures. Man y of them are applied to the formation and manipulation of\\nsymbol structures (the purpose of which will often be to support the conceptual labor in volved in process\\nstructuring). 2c5c5c\\n6) Physical Structuring 2c5c6\\nPhysical structuring , the last of the fiv e types which we currently use in our conceptual fr amework, is\\nnearly self -explanatory . It prett y well represents the artifact component of our augmentation means,\\ninsofar as their actual ph ysical construction is concerned. 2c5c6a\\n7) Interdependence and Regeneration 2c5c7\\nA very important feature to be noted from the discussion in this section bears upon the interdependence\\namong the v arious t ypes of structuring which are in volved in the H-LAM/T system, where the capabilit y\\nfor doing each t ype of structuring is dependent upon the capabilit y for doing one or more of the other\\ntypes of structuring.

W e\\nhave seen how the capabilit y for mental structuring is finally dependent, down the chain, upon the\\nprocess structuring (human, artifact, composite) that enables symbol-structure manipulation. But it also\\nis evident that the process structuring is dependent not only upon basic human and artifact process\\ncapabilities, but upon the abilit y of the human to learn how to ex ecute processes— and no less\\nimportant, upon the abilit y of the human to select, organiz e, and modif y processes from his repertoire to\\nstructure a higher -order process that he can ex ecute.

A t one time or another he will be the policy\\nmaker, the goal setter , the performance supervisor , the work scheduler , the professional specialist, the\\nclerk, the janitor , the entrepreneur , and the proprietor (or at least a major stockholder) of the system. In\\nthe midst of some complex process, in fact, he ma y well be pla ying sev eral roles concurrently —or at least\\nhave the responsibilit y of the roles. F or instance, usually he must be a ware of his progress tow ard a goal\\n(supervisor), he must be alert to the possibilities for changing the goal (policy mak er, planner), and he\\nmust k eep records for these and other roles (clerk). 2c5d1\\nConsider a giv en capabilit y (Capabilit y 1) at some lev el in the repertoire hier archy. There seems to be a\\nsort of standard grouping of lower -order capabilities from which this is composed, and these exist in two\\nclasses— what we might call the executive  class and what we might call the direct-contributive  class. In the\\nexecutiv e class of capabilities we find those used for comprehending, planning, and ex ecuting the process\\nrepresented b y Capabilit y 1. In the direct -contributiv e class we find the capabilities organiz ed by the\\nexecutiv e class tow ard the direct realization of Capabilit y 1. F or example, when m y telephone rings, I\\nexecute the direct -contributiv e processes of picking up the receiv er and sa ying hello .

That represents the composition of m y capabilit y for answering the phone. 2c5d2\\nFor a low -level capabilit y, such as that of writing a word with a pencil, both the ex ecutiv e and the direct -\\ncontributiv e subprocesses during actual ex ecution would be automatic. This t ype of automatic capabilit y\\nneed only be summoned b y a higher ex ecutiv e process in order for tr ained automatic responses to ex ecute\\nit. 2c5d3\\nAt a little higher lev el of capabilit y, more of the conscious conceptual and ex ecutiv e capabilities become\\ninvolved. To call someone on the telephone, I must consciously comprehend the need for this process and\\nhow I can ex ecute it, I must consciously pick up the directory and search for the name and telephone\\nnumber , and I must consciously direct the dialing of the number . 2c5d4\\nAt a still higher lev el of capabilit y, the ex ecutiv e capabilities must ha ve a degree of power that unaided\\nmental capabilities cannot pro vide. In such a case, one might mak e a list of steps and check each item off\\nas it is ex ecuted. F or an ev en more complex process, comprehending the particular situation in which it is\\nto be ex ecuted, ev en before beginning to plan the ex ecution, ma y take months of labor and a v ery complex\\norganization of the system's capabilities. 2c5d5\\nImagining a process as complex as the last example brings us to the realization that at an y particular\\nmoment the H-LAM/T system ma y be in the middle of ex ecuting a great number of processes. Assume that\\nthe human is in the middle of the process of making a telephone call. That telephone call is a subprocess in\\nthe middle of the process of calling a committee meeting. But calling a committee meeting is a subprocess\\nin the middle of the process of determining a budgetary policy , which is in turn but a subprocess in the\\nmiddle of the process of estimating manpower needs, and so on. 2c5d6\\nNot only does the human need to pla y various roles (sometimes concurrently) in the ex ecution of an y given\\nprocess, but he is pla ying these roles for the man y concurrent processes that are being ex ecuted at\\ndifferent lev els. This situation is t ypical for an y of us engaged in reasonably demanding t ypes of\\nprofessional pursuits, and y et we ha ve nev er receiv ed explicit tr aining in optimum w ays of carrying out an y\\nbut a v ery few of the roles at a v ery few of the lev els.

W e can illustr ate this ex ecutiv e superstructure b y considering it as\\nthough it were a network of contr actors and subcontr actors in which each capabilit y in the repertoire\\nhierarchy is represented b y an independent contr actor whose mode of oper ation is to do the planning,\\nmake up specifications, subcontr act the actual work, and supervise the performance of his subcontr actors.\\nThis means that each subcontr actor does the same thing in his turn. A t the bottom of this hier archy are\\nthose independent contr actors who do actual \"production work.\" 2c5e1\\nIf by some magical process the production work ers could still know just what to do and when to do it ev en\\nthough the superstructure of contr actors w as remo ved from abo ve them, no one would know the\\ndifference. The ex ecutiv e superstructure is necessary because humans do not oper ate by magic, but ev en a\\nnecessary superstructure is a burden. W e can readily recogniz e that there are man y ways to organiz e and\\nmanage such a superstructure, resulting in v astly different degrees of efficiency in the application of the\\nworkers\\' talents. 2c5e2\\nSuppose that the activit y of the production work ers w as of the same nature as the activit y of the different\\ncontractors, and that this activit y consisted of gaining comprehension and solving problems. And suppose\\nthat there w as only so much applicable talent a vailable to the total system. The question now becomes how\\nto distribute that talent between superstructure and work ers to get the most total production. The\\nefficiency of organization within the superstructure is now doubly important so that a minimum of talent in\\nthe superstructure produces a maximum of organizational efficiency in directing the productivit y of the\\nremaining talent. 2c5e3\\nIn the situation where talent is limited, we find a close par allel to our H-LAM/T system in its pursuit of\\ncomprehension and problem solutions. W e obtain an ev en closer par allel if we sa y that the thinking,\\nplanning, supervising, record k eeping, etc. , for each contr actor is actually done b y a single individual for\\nthe whole superstructure, time-sharing his attention and talents o ver these man y tasks. T oday this\\nindividual cannot be depended upon to ha ve any special tr aining for man y of these roles; he is lik ely to\\nhave learned them b y cut and try and b y indirect imitation. 2c5e4\\nA complex process is often ex ecuted b y the H-LAM/T system in a multi-pass fashion (i.e. , cut and try). In\\nreally complex situations, comprehension and problem solutions do not stand w aiting at the end of a\\nstraightforw ard path; instead, possibilities open up and plans shift as comprehension grows. In the model\\nusing a network of contr actors, this t ype of procedure would entail a great deal of extr a work within the\\nsuperstructure—each contr actor in volved in the process would ha ve the specifications upon which he bid\\ncontinually changed, and would continually ha ve to respond to the changes b y restudying the situation,\\nchanging his plans, changing the specifications to his subcontr actors, and changing his records.

More human time, energy , and productiv e\\nthought could be allocated to direct -contributiv e processes, which would be coordinated in a more\\nsophisticated, flexible and efficient manner . But there is ev ery reason to believ e that the possibilities for\\nmuch-impro ved symbol and process structuring that would stem from this automation will directly pro vide\\nimpro vements in both the ex ecutiv e and direct -contributiv e processes in the system. 2c5e6\\ne. Flexibility in the Executive Role 2c5f\\nThe ex ecutiv e superstructure is a necessary component in the H-LAM/T system, and there is finite human\\ncapabilit y which must be divided between ex ecutiv e and direct -contributiv e activities. An important aspect\\nof the multi-role activit y of the human in the system is the dev elopment and manipulation of the symbol\\nstructures associated with both his direct -contributiv e roles and his ex ecutiv e roles. 2c5f1\\nWhen the system encounters a complex situation in which comprehension and problem solutions are being\\npursued, the direct -contributiv e roles require the dev elopment of symbol structures that portr ay the\\nconcepts in volved within the situation. But ex ecutiv e roles in a complex problem situation also require\\nconceptual activit y—e.g. , comprehension, selection, supervision—that can benefit from well-designed\\nsymbol structures and fast, flexible means for manipulating and displa ying them. F or complex processes,\\nthe ex ecutiv e problem posed to the human (of gaining the necessary comprehension and making a good\\nplan) ma y be tougher than the problem he faced in the role of direct -contributiv e work er. If the flexibilit y\\ndesired for the process hier archies (to mak e room for human cut -and-try methods) is not to be degr aded\\nor abandoned, the ex ecutiv e activit y will ha ve to be pro vided with fast and flexible symbol-structuring\\ntechniques. 2c5f2\\nThe means a vailable to humans toda y for dev eloping and manipulating these symbol structures are both\\nlaborious and inflexible. It is hard enough to dev elop an initial structure of diagr ams and text, but the\\namount of effort required to mak e changes is often prohibitiv ely great; one settles for inflexibilit y. Also , the\\nkind of generous flexibilit y that would be truly helpful calls for added symbol structuring just to k eep tr ack\\nof the trials, br anches, and reasoning thereto that are in volved in the dev elopment of the subject structure;\\nour present symbol-manipulation means would v ery soon bog down completely among the complexities\\nthat are in volved in being more than just a little bit flexible. 2c5f3\\nWe find that the humans in our H-LAM/T systems are essential working continuously within a symbol\\nstructure of some sort, shifting their attention from one structure to another as they guide and ex ecute the', metadata={'source': './assets-resources/Augmenting-Human-Intellect_ A-Conceptual-Framework-1962-Doug Engelbart.pdf', 'page': 31}),\n",

Such a capabilit y depends hea vily upon the particular concepts that\\nare isolated and manipulated as entities, upon the symbology used to represent them, upon the artifacts\\nthat help to manipulate and displa y the symbols, and upon the methodology for dev eloping and using\\nsymbol structures. In other words, this capabilit y depends hea vily upon proper language, artifacts, and\\nmethodology , our basic augmentation means. 2c5f4\\nWhen the course of action must respond to new comprehension, new insights and new intuitiv e flashes of\\npossible explanations or solutions, it will not be an orderly process. Existing means of composing and\\nworking with symbol structures penaliz e disorderly processes v ery hea vily, and it is part of the real promise\\nin the automated H-LAM/T systems of tomorrow that the human can ha ve the freedom and power of\\ndisorderly processes. 2c5f5\\nf.

The augmentation means emplo yed toda y have gener ally ev olved among large\\nstatistical populations, and no attempt has been made to fit them to individual needs and abilities.

This organization, as we ha ve shown in Section II ,\\ncan be viewed as the fiv e different t ypes of structuring which we outlined, where much of the structuring that\\ngoes on in the human\\'s total problem solving activit y is for the purpose of building a mental structure which in a\\nway \"puts the human up where he can see what is going on and can point the direction to mo ve next.\" 3a3\\nAn early paper , offering suggestions tow ard augmenting the human intellect, that fits well and significantly within\\nthe fr amework which we ha ve dev eloped w as written b y Vannev ar Bush[6] in 1945.

What Vannevar Bush proposed in 1945 3a5\\nHe wrote as W orld W ar II w as coming to an end, and his principal purpose seemed to be to offer new\\nprofessional objectiv es to those scientists who were soon to be freed from w ar-motiv ated research and\\ndevelopment.

He summariz ed the situation: \"...There is a growing mountain of research...The\\ninvestigator is staggered b y the findings and conclusions of thousands of other work ers. Professionally our\\nmethods of tr ansmitting and reviewing the results of research are gener ations old...truly significant\\nattainments become lost in the mass of the inconsequential...The summation of human experience is being\\nexpanded at a prodigious r ate, and the means we use for threading through the consequent maz e to the\\nmomentarily important item is the same as w as used in the da ys of square-rigged ships.\" 3a5a\\nThen he brought out some gener al consider ations for hope: \"...

He suggests that new notation for our\\nverbal symbols (perhaps binary) could allow char acter recognition devices to help ev en further in the\\ninformation-manipulation area, and also points out that poor symbolism (\"...the ex ceedingly crude w ay in\\nwhich mathematicians express their relationships.

Each such specific problem area has its notecards k ept in a separ ate deck, and for each such deck\\nthere is a master card with descriptors associated with individual holes about the periphery of the card.\\nThere is a field of holes reserv ed for notch coding the serial number of a reference from which the note on\\na card ma y have been tak en, or the serial number corresponding to an individual from whom the\\ninformation came directly (including a code for m yself, for self -gener ated thoughts). 3a7b1\\nNone of the principles of indexing or sorting used here is new: coordinate-indexing descriptors with direct\\ncoding on edge notched cards, with needle-sort retriev al. Mainly what is new is the use of the smaller units\\nof information, in restricted-subject sets (notedecks) so that I gain consider able flexibilit y in the\\nmanipulations of m y thought products at the lev el at which I actually work in m y minute-b y-minute\\nstruggle with analytical and formulativ e thought. Not only do m y own thoughts produce results in this\\nfashion, but when I digest the writings of another person, I find gener ally an yway that I ha ve extr acted\\nfrom his structure and integr ated into m y own a specific selection of facts, consider ations, ideas, etc. Often\\nthese different extr acted items fit into different places in m y structure, or become encased in special\\nsubstructures as I modif y or expand his concepts. Extr acting such items or k ernels and putting each on its\\nown notecard helps this process consider ably—the role or position of each such item in the growth of the\\nnote structure is independent, and y et if desired all can quickly be isolated and extr acted b y simple needle\\nsorting on the reference-number notching field. 3a7b2\\nThese notecards represent much more than just an in formation file.

The notches on the edges of the cards are symbols that serv e to tie these\\ncard-siz ed symbol sub structures into a large symbol structure (the notedeck). One aspect of the structure\\nis the ph ysical grouping of the cards at a giv en time— which happens to be the only aspect of the o ver-all\\nstructuring that m y human capabilities can mak e direct use of —and in this respect I can ex ecute processes\\nwhich produce restructuring (that is, ph ysical re grouping) that helps me consider ably to perceiv e and\\nassimilate the concepts of worth to me. This restructuring is effected b y composite processes in volving me,\\na master code card, a sorting needle, and a work surface. I can add to the symbol structure b y executing\\nother composite processes which in volve me, writing instruments (pen, pencil, or t ypewriter), a master\\ncode card, and a card notcher . 3a7c1\\nIf my mental processes were more powerful, I could dispense with the cards, and hold all of the card-siz ed\\nconcept structures in m y memory , where also would be held the categorization linkages that ev olved as I\\nworked (with m y feet up on the artifacts and m y eyes closed). As it is, and as it probably alw ays will be no\\nmatter how we dev elop or tr ain our mental capabilities, I w ant to work in problem areas where the number\\nand interrelationship complexit y of the individual factors in volved are too much for me to hold and\\nmanipulate within m y mind. So , my mind dev elops conscious sets of concepts, or recogniz es and selects\\nthem from what it perceiv es in the work of others, and it directs the organization of an external symbol\\nstructure in which can be held and portr ayed to the mind those concepts I cannot (reliably) remember or\\nwhose manipulations I cannot visualiz e. The price I pa y for this augmentation shows up in the time and\\nenergy in volved in manipulating artifacts to manipulate symbols to giv e me this artificial memory and\\nvisualization of concepts and their manipulation. 3a7c2\\nc. Associative-Linking Possibilities 3a7d\\nBut let us go further with discussing specific examples of means for augmenting our intellects. In using the\\nedge-notched-card system described, I found sev eral types of structuring which that system could not\\nprovide, but which would both be v ery useful and probably obtainable with reasonably pr actical artifact\\nmeans. One need arose quite commonly as tr ains of thought would dev elop on a growing series of note\\ncards. There w as no con venient w ay to link these cards together so that the tr ain of thought could later be\\nrecalled b y extr acting the ordered series of notecards. An associativ e-trail scheme similar to that out lined\\nby Bush for his Memex could conceiv ably be implemented with these cards to meet this need and add a\\nvaluable new symbol-structuring process to the system. Str aightforw ard engineering dev elopment could\\nprovide a mechanism that would be able to select a specific card from a relativ ely large deck b y a par allel\\nedge-notch sort on a unique serial number notched into each card, and the search mechanism could be set\\nup automatically b y a hole sensing mechanism from internal punches on another card that w as placed in\\nthe sensing slot. An auxiliary notching mechanism could automatically giv e succeeding serial-number\\nencoding to new notecards as they are made up . 3a7d1', metadata={'source': './assets-resources/Augmenting-Human-Intellect_ A-Conceptual-Framework-1962-Doug Engelbart.pdf', 'page': 42}),\n",

He puts Card B into a slot so\\nthat the edge-notched coding of the card\\'s serial number can automatically be sensed, and slips Card A\\nunder a hole-punching head which duplicates the serial-number code of Card B in the coding of the holes\\npunched in a specific z one on Card A. Later , when he ma y have disco vered Card A, and wishes to follow\\nthis particular associativ e trail to the next card, he aligns that z one on Card A under a hole-sensing head\\nwhich reads the serial number for Card B therein and automatically sets up the sorting mechanism. A v ery\\nquick and simple human process thus initiates the automatic extr action of the next item on the associativ e\\ntrail. It\\'s not unreasonable to assume that establishing a link would tak e about three seconds, and tr acing a\\nlink to the next card about three to fiv e seconds. 3a7d2\\nThere would still be descriptor -code notching and selection to pro vide for gener al grouping classifications—\\nand we can see that the system could really pro vide a means for working within  the structure of the\\ncontained information. 3a7d3\\nd. An Experiment Illustrating Usage and Further System Possibilities 3a7e\\nI once tried to use m y cards, with their separ ate little \"concept pack ets,\" in the process of dev eloping a file\\nmemo outlining the status and plans of a research project. I first dev eloped a set of cards upon each of\\nwhich I described a separ ate consider ation, possibilit y, or specification about the memo—in the disorderly\\nsequence in which they occurred to me as m y thoughts about the basic features of the memo ev olved.\\nRight off the bat I noticed that there were two distinct groups—some ideas were about what the memo\\nought to accomplish, what time period it should co ver, when it should be finished, what lev el and st yle of\\npresentation should be used, etc. , and some ideas were about the subject of the memo . As more thoughts\\ndeveloped, I found that the latter group also divided into ideas representing possible content and those\\nrepresenting possible organization. 3a7e1\\nI separ ated the cards into three corresponding groups (which I shall call Specification, Organization, and\\nContent), and began to organiz e each of them. I started with the Specification group (it being the \"highest\"\\nin nature), and immediately found that there were sev eral types of notes within that group Just as there\\nhad been in the total group . Becoming immediately suspicious, I sorted through each of the other two main\\ngroups and found similar situations in each. In each group there w as finally to emerge a definite set of\\nstatements (product statements) that represented that group\\'s purpose—e.g. , the specifications currently\\naccepted for the design of the memo— and some of the cards contained candidate material for this. But\\nthere were also consider ations about what these final statements might include or ex clude or tak e into\\naccount, or conditions under which inclusion or modification might be relev ant, or statements that were too\\nbulky or brief or imprecise to be used as final statements. 3a7e2', metadata={'source': './assets-resources/Augmenting-Human-Intellect_ A-Conceptual-Framework-1962-Doug Engelbart.pdf', 'page': 43}),\n",

I realiz ed that I w as\\nbeing r ather philosophically introspectiv e with all of this analysis, but I w as curious as to the potential v alue\\nof future augmentation means in allowing me to deal explicitly with these t ypes of structuring.

This brought me to appreciate the v alue of some sort of cop ying device with which I could tr ansfer\\nspecified strings of words from one card to another , thus composing new statements from fr agments of\\nexisting ones. This t ype of device should not be too hard to dev elop and produce for a price that a\\nprofessional man could justif y paying, and it would certainly facilitate some v aluable symbol-structuring pro\\n3a7e4\\nI also found that there would ha ve been great v alue in ha ving a vailable the associativ e-trail marking\\nand following processes. Statements v ery often had implicit linkages to other statements in the same\\ngroup , and it would ha ve been v ery useful to k eep tr ack of these associations. F or instance, when sev eral\\nconsider ation statements bore upon a giv en product statement, and when that product statement came to\\nbe modified through some other consider ation, it w as not alw ays easy to remember wh y it had been\\nestablished has it had. Being able to fish out the other consider ations link ed to that statement would ha ve\\nhelped consider ably. 3a7e5\\nAlso, trial organizations of the statements in a group could be link ed into trial associativ e trails, so that a\\nnumber of such organizations could be constructed and considered without cop ying that man y sets of\\nspecially ordered statements. An y of the previously considered organizations could be reconstructed at will.\\n3a7e6\\nIn trying to do flexible structuring and restructuring within m y experiment, I found that I just didn't\\nhave the means to k eep tr ack of all of the k ernel statements (cards) and the v arious relation ships between\\nthem that were important —at least b y means that were easy enough to lea ve time and thought capacit y\\nenough for me to k eep in mind the essential nature of the memo- writing process.

There ma y be from ten to o ver a\\nhundred different primitiv e processes which a particular machine can ex ecute, and all of the computer\\'s more\\nsophisticated processes are structured from these primitiv e processes. It tak es a repertoire of surprisingly few\\nsuch primitiv e processes to enable the construction of an y symbol-manipulation process that can be explicitly\\ndescribed in an y language. 3a8b\\nSomewhat the same situation exists relativ e to symbol structures i.e. , there are only a v ery few primitiv e\\nsymbols with which the machine can actually work, and an y new and different symbol has to be defined to the\\nmachine as a particular structure (or organization) of its primitiv e symbols. Actually , in ev ery commercial\\ndigital computer , there are only two primitiv e symbols. Usually these are dealt with in standard-siz ed pack ets\\n(called \"words\") of from eighteen to fort y-eight primitiv e symbols, but arbitr ary use can be made of individual\\nprimitiv es or of subgroups of the word. 3a8c\\nTo have the computer perform a non-trivial task or process, a structure of the primitiv e processes is organiz ed\\n(a computer progr am) and stored within the computer as a corresponding symbol structure. The computer\\nsuccessiv ely examines the symbol substructure representing each primitiv e process in the progr am and\\nexecutes that process— which usually alters the total internal symbol structure of the machine in some w ay. Lt\\nmakes no difference to the computer whether the symbols in volved in the re-structuring represent part of the\\ncomputer progr am or part of the information upon which the progr am is oper ating. The abilit y to ha ve the\\ncomputer modif y its own process structure (progr am) has been a v ery important factor in the dev elopment of\\nits power . 3a8d\\nThus, some v ery sophisticated techniques for process and symbol structuring ha ve evolved in the computer\\nfield, as evidenced b y the v ery sophisticated processes (e.g. , predicting election returns, calculating orbits,\\ntranslating natur al languages) that can be structured to manipulate v ery complex structures of symbols.\\nAmong the more interesting computer -process structures that ha ve evolved are those that can automatically\\ndevelop a structure of primitiv e computer processes to accomplish symbol manipulation tasks that are\\nspecified on a relativ ely high lev el of abstr action. Special languages ha ve been ev olved in sev eral fields (e.g. ,\\nALGOL and FOR TRAN for scientific calculations, COBOL for business processing) that enable explicit\\nprescription of complex manipulation processes in a r apid and concise manner b y a human, thinking about the\\nprocesses in a r ather natur al manner , so that special computer progr ams or process structures (called\\nTranslators, Compilers, or sometimes in a slightly different sense, Interpreters) can construct the necessary\\nstructures of primitiv e processes and symbols that would enable the computer to ex ecute the prescribed\\nprocesses.

F or\\none, they disco vered that the symbol structures and the process structures required for such simulation\\nbecame ex ceedingly complex, and the burden of organizing these w as a terrific impediment to their simulation\\nresearch. They devised a structuring technique for their symbols that is basically simple but from which stem\\nresults that are v ery elegant. Their basic symbol structure is what they call a \\'list,\" a string of substructures\\nthat are link ed serially in exactly the manner proposed b y Bush for the associativ e trails in his Memex —i.e.,\\neach substructure contains the necessary information for locating the next substructure on the list. Here,\\nthough, each substructure could also be a list of substructures, and each of these could also , etc. Their\\nstandard manner for organizing the data which the computer w as to oper ate upon is thus what they term \"list\\nstructuring.\" 3a8f\\nThey also dev eloped special languages to describe different basic processes in volved in list -structure\\nmanipulation. The most widely used of their languages, IPL -V (the fifth v ersion of their Information Processing\\nLanguages), is described in a recent book edited b y Newell[7]. In these languages, both the data to be work ed\\nupon and the symbols which designate the processes to be ex ecuted upon that data are dev eloped in list -\\nstructure form. 3a8g\\nOther languages and techniques for the manipulation of list structures ha ve been described b y McCarth y,[8] by\\nGelernter , Hansen, and Gerberich,[9] by Yngve,[10, 11] by Perlis and Thornton,[12] by Carr ,[13] and b y\\nWeizenbaum.[14] The application of these techniques has been mainly of two t ypes—one of modelling complex\\nprocesses and systems (e.g. , the human thought processes), where the emphasis is upon the model and its\\nbehavior, and the other of trying to get computer beha vior that is intelligent whether or not the processes and\\nbehavior resemble those of a human. The languages and techniques used in both t ypes of application promise\\nto be of consider able v alue to the dev elopment of r adical new augmentation systems for human problem\\nsolvers, and we shall deal later with them in more detail. 3a8h\\nComputers ha ve various means for storing symbols so that they are accessible to it for manipulation.\\nAssuming that the human might w ant to ha ve a repertoire of sixt y-four basic symbols (letters, numbers,\\nspecial symbols), we can discuss v arious forms of stor age in terms of their capacit y for storing these kinds of\\nsymbols (each of which would be structured, in the computer and stor age devices, as a group of six primitiv e', metadata={'source': './assets-resources/Augmenting-Human-Intellect_ A-Conceptual-Framework-1962-Doug Engelbart.pdf', 'page': 47}),\n",

F ast access to an arbitr ary choice of a few neighboring symbols (of the human\\'s\\nrepertoire) can be had to perhaps 100,000 such symbols within the period in which the computer can ex ecute\\none of its primitiv e processes (from two to ten millionths of a second, depending upon the computer\\ninvolved). This is the so-called high-speed, r andom- access working store, where space for the human\\'s\\nsymbols might cost between sixt y cents and $1.50 per symbol. 3a8i\\nCheaper , larger -capacit y backup stor age is usually pro vided b y devices to which access tak es consider ably\\nlonger (in the computer\\'s time reference). A continuously rotating magnetic drum can hold perhaps a million\\nof these symbols, for which access to a r andom stor age position ma y average a thirtieth of a second (w aiting\\nfor the drum to come around to bring that stor age position under the magnetic reading head). This is short in\\nthe human\\'s time scale, but a reasonably fast computer could ex ecute about 3,000 of its primitiv e processes\\nduring that time. Gener ally, information tr ansfer between a drum and fast -access working stor age tak es place\\nin blocks of data which are stored in successiv e positions around the drum. Such block -transfer is\\naccomplished b y a relativ ely small structure of primitiv e computer processes that cy clically ex ecutes the\\ntransfer of one word at a time until the designated block has been tr ansferred. Drum stor age costs about 5\\ncents per each of the basic symbols used b y the human in our example. 3a8j\\nAnother t ype of backup stor age uses a number of large, thin discs (about three feet in diameter), with\\nmagnetic coating on the surfaces. The discs are stack ed with enough space between each so that a mo veable\\nread-record head can be positioned r adially to line up o ver a specific circular tr ack of symbol stor age space. A\\ncommercially a vailable disc stor age system could hold o ver a hundred million of the human\\'s basic symbols,\\nto which r andom access would a verage about a tenth of a second, and where the cost per symbol-space\\nwould be about one sev enth of a cent. 3a8k\\nMagnetic tapes are commonly used for backup stor age, too . For these, the r andom access time for stor age\\nblocks are of the order of a minute or two . Here, howev er, the actual stor age units (the tape reels) can be\\ntaken off and shelf stored, so the total stor age capacit y may be v ery large—howev er, the time to locate a reel\\nand ex change reels on the tape tr ansport adds to the abo ve-quoted access time— and this locating and reel\\nchanging are not gener ally automatic processes (i.e. , a human has to do them). A tr ansport unit, connected to\\nthe computer , might cost $30,000, with tape reels at $50 each holding about fiv e million of the human\\'s basic\\nsymbols. F or one reel, stor age space for each such symbol cost about two-thirds of a cent, but for twent y full\\nreels in a \"libr ary\" the cost comes down to about one-thirtieth of a cent per symbol space. 3a8l\\nOther t ypes of buffer stor age for computer symbol structures are becoming a vailable, and there is\\nconsider able economic demand spurring continuing research tow ard stor age means that giv e high capacit y at\\nlow cost, and with as short an access time as possible.

On displa ys of this sort, a light pen (a pen-shaped tool with a\\nflexible wire to the electronic console) can be pointed b y the human at an y symbol or line on the displa y, and\\nthe computer can automatically determine what the pen is pointing at. 3a8n\\nA cathode-r ay-tube displa y of this sort is currently limited in resolution to about 800 lines across the face of\\nthe tube (in either direction). The detail with which a symbol ma y be formed, and the preciseness with which\\nthe recurrent images of it ma y be located, are both affected b y this figure so that no matter how large the\\nscreen of such a tube, the maximum number of symbols that can be put on with usable clearness remains the\\nsame. 3a8o\\nThe amount of usable information on such a screen, in the form of letters, numbers, and diagr ams, would be\\nlimited to about what a normal human ey e could mak e out at the normal reading distance of fourteen inches\\non a surface 3-1/2 inches square, or to what one could discern on an ordinary 8-1/2-b y-11-inch sheet of\\npaper at about three feet.

Under these conditions, giving reference to a backup source would usually entail qualif ying footnotes\\nreflecting an unusual interpretation or ex onerating the other author from the implications we deriv ed from his\\nwork. W e look forw ard to a stronger , more comprehensiv e, and more scholarly presentation ev olving out of\\nfuture work. 3a9a\\nHowev er, we do w ant to acknowledge thoughts and work we ha ve come across that bear most directly upon\\nthe possibilities of using a computer in real-time working association with a human to impro ve his working\\neffectiv eness. These fall into two categories. The first category , which would include this report, presents\\nspeculations and possibilities but does not include reporting of significant experimental results. Of these,\\nBush[6] is the earliest and one of the most directly stimulating. Licklider[15] provided the most gener al clear\\ncase for the modern computer , and coined the expression, \"man-computer symbiosis\" to refer to the close\\ninteraction relationship between the man and computer in mutually beneficial cooper ation. Ulam[16] has\\nspecifically recommended close man-computer inter action in a chapter entitled, \"synergesis,\" where he points\\nout in consider able detail the t ypes of mathematical work which could be aided. Good[17] includes some\\nconjecture about possibilities of intellectual aid to the human b y close cooper ation with a computer in a r ather\\ngener al way, and also presents a few interesting thoughts about a network model for structuring the\\nconceptual k ernels of information to facilitate a sort of self -organizing retriev al system. R amo has giv en a\\nnumber of talks dealing with the future possibilities of computers for \"extending man\\'s intellect,\" and wrote\\nseveral articles.[18, 19] His projections seem slanted more tow ard larger bodies of humans inter acting with\\ncomputers, in less of an intimate personal sense than the abo ve papers or than our initial goal. F ein[20] in\\nmaking a comprehensiv e projection of the growth and dynamic inter -relatedness of \"computer -related\\nsciences,\" includes specific mention of the enhancement of human intellect b y cooper ative activit y of men,\\nmechanisms, and automata. He coined the term \"synnoetics\" as applicable gener ally to the cooper ative\\ninteraction of people, mechanisms, plant or animal organisms, and automata into a system whose mental\\npower is greater than that of its components, and presented a good picture of the integr ated w ay in which\\nmany currently separ ate disciplines should be dev eloped and taught in the future to do justice to their mutual\\nroles in the important metadiscipline defined as \"synnoetics.\" 3a9b\\nIn the second category , there ha ve been a few papers published recently describing actual work that bears\\ndirectly upon our topic. Licklider and Clark,[21] and Culler and Huff ,[22] in the 1962 Spring Joint Computer\\nConference, ga ve what are essentially progress reports of work going on now in exactly this sort of thing— a\\nhuman with a computer back ed displa y getting minute-b y-minute help in solving problems.

This low -level\\ncomposition task is just what y ou normally do with a pen or pencil or t ypewriter on a piece of paper —that is,\\nassemble a bunch of symbols before y our ey es in order to portr ay something which y ou ha ve in mind.\" 3b4a\\nYou listened and w atched as Joe showed y ou some of the different w ays in which the composition of\\nstraightforw ard text w as made easier for him in this system. With either hand, Joe could \"t ype\" (the k eysets\\ndidn\\'t look at all lik e typewriter k eyboards) individual letters and numbers, and if he had directed it to do so ,\\nthe computer would put each successiv e symbol next to its predecessor just as a t ypewriter does—only here\\nthere w as completely automatic \"carriage return\" service. This didn\\'t impress y ou very much, since an\\nautomatic carriage-return feature w as sort of a trivial return on the in vestment behind all of this equipment —\\nbut then y ou reflected that, as long as the computer w as there an yway, to help do all the flash y things y ou\\nhad witnessed earlier , one might as well use it in all of the little helpful w ays he could. 3b4b\\nBut there were other w ays in which help w as deriv ed for this composition task. He showed y ou how he could\\ncall up the dictionary definition to an y word he had t yped in, with but a few quick flicks on the k eyset.\\nSynonyms or anton yms could just as easily be brought forth. This also seemed sort of trivially obvious, and\\nJoe seemed to know that y ou would feel so . \"It turns out that this simple capabilit y mak es it feasible to do\\nsome prett y rough tasks in the upper lev els of the capabilit y hier archy—where precise use of special terms\\nreally pa ys off , where the human just couldn\\'t be that precise b y depending upon his unaided memory for\\ndefinitions and \\'standards,\\' and where using dictionary and reference-book lookup in the normal fashion would\\nbe so distr acting and time-consuming that the task ex ecution would break down.

A t any later time (until he chose to discard that particular\\nabbreviation from his working v ocabulary) the t yping of the abbreviation term would call forth automatically\\nthe \"printing\" on the displa y of the entire object string. Joe showed y ou another w ay in which this\\nabbreviation feature might work. He \"arr anged\" for the computer to print the abbreviation on the displa y, just\\nthe w ay he t yped it in.

He could hit a great man y combinations of k eys on his k eyset —i.e., any one strok e of his\\nhand could depress a number of k eys, which ga ve him o ver a thousand unique single-strok e signals to the\\ncomputer with either hand. Some of these signals were used as abbreviations for entire words. It seems that,\\nfor instance, the 150 most commonly used words in a natur al language made up about half of an y normal text\\nin that language. Joe said that it w as thus quite feasible to learn and use the single-strok e abbreviations for\\nabout half of the words he used, but bey ond that each added percent began to require him to ha ve too man y\\nabbreviations under his command. But he said that there were a lot of word endings, letter pairs (diagr ams),\\nand letter triplets (trigr ams) that were so common as to mak e it pa y to abbreviate them to a single strok e. A\\nwhole word so abbreviated sa ved typing all the letters as well as the spaces at either side of the word, and a\\nword-ending abbreviated b y a single strok e saved typing the letters and the end-of -word space. He claimed\\nthat he could comfortably r attle off about 180 words a minute—faster than he could comfortably talk. Y ou\\nbeliev ed him after he tr anscribed y our talking for a minute or so , and it ga ve you an eerie feeling to see the\\nnear instantaneous appear ance of y our words and sentences in neat printed form. 3b4e\\nJoe said that there were other miscellaneous simple features, and some quite sophisticated features to help\\nthe composition process. He made some brief references to statistical predictions that the computer could\\nmake regarding what y ou were going to t ype next, and that if y ou got reasonably skillful y ou could \"steer\\nthrough the extr apolated prediction field\" as y ou entered y our information and often sa ve energy and time.\\nYou gathered that he thought y ou would satur ate about there on this particular subject, because he went on\\nto the next. 3b4f\\n3.

The fr ame full of y our tr anscribed speech w as still\\nshowing, and it represented the clumsy phr asing and illogical progression of thought so t ypical of\\nextempor aneous speech. Joe took the light gun in his right hand, and with a deft flick of it, coordinated with a\\nstroke of his left hand on its k eyset, caused the silent and instantaneous deletion of a superfluous word. The\\nword disappeared from the fr ame, and the rest of the text simultaneously readjusted to present the neat, no-\\ngap, full-line appear ance it had had. 3b5a\\nWith but slightly more motion of his light pen, he could similarly delete an y string of words or letters.

Lea ving his light pen pointed at the space where\\na deleted symbol string used to be, Joe could reinstate it instantaneously with one strok e of his left hand. 3b5b\\nAdding one more light -pen pointing to what it took to delete an arbitr ary string of symbols, Joe could direct\\nthe computer to mo ve that string from where it w as to insert it at a new point which his light pen designated.\\nAgain it would disappear instantaneously from where it had been, but now the modified displa y would show\\nthe old text to ha ve been spread apart just enough at the indicated point to hold this string. The text would all\\nstill look as neat as if freshly ret yped. With similar t ypes of k eyset and light -pen oper ations, Joe could change\\nparagraph break points, tr anspose two arbitr ary symbol strings (words, sentences, par agraphs, etc. , or\\nfragments thereof ), readjust margins of arbitr ary sections of text —essentially being able to affect immediately\\nany of the changes that a proofreader might w ant to designate with his special marks, only here the\\nproofreader is alw ays looking at clean text as if it had been instantaneously ret yped after each designation\\nhad been made. 3b5c\\nJoe also demonstr ated how he could request that each instance of the use of a giv en term be changed to a\\nnewly designated term, and this would again be instantaneously accomplished. Also , he could arbitr arily set\\nthe margins between which an y section of text must appear , and its line lengths and number of lines would\\nautomatically be adjusted.

One of the sections of\\ntext w as about a third longer than the other —but two quick strok es with Joe\\'s left hand caused the computer\\nto adjust the displa y automatically .

W ell, we do ha ve to think through these steps\\nserially , and we usually do list the steps serially when we write them out because that is prett y much the w ay\\nour papers and books ha ve to present them—they are prett y limiting in the symbol structuring they enable us\\nto use. Ha ve you ev en seen a \\'scr ambled-text\\' progr ammed instruction book? That is an interesting example\\nof a deviation from str aight serial presentation of steps. 3b6b\\n\"Conceptually speaking, howev er, an argument is not a serial affair . It is sequential, I gr ant you, because\\nsome statements ha ve to follow others, but this doesn\\'t imply that its nature is necessarily serial. W e usually\\nstring Statement B after Statement A, with Statements C, D , E, F, and so on following in that order —this is a\\nserial structuring of our symbols. P erhaps each statement logically followed from all those which preceded it\\non the serial list, and if so , then the conceptual structuring would also be serial in nature, and it would be\\nnicely matched for us b y the symbol structuring. 3b6c\\n\"But a more t ypical case might find A to be an independent statement, B dependent upon A, C and D\\nindependent, E depending upon D and B , E dependent upon C, and F dependent upon A, D , and E. See,\\nsequential but not serial? A conceptual network but not a conceptual chain. The old paper and pencil methods\\nof manipulating symbols just weren\\'t v ery adaptable to making and using symbol structures to match the\\nways we mak e and use conceptual structures.

But the same computer here that giv es us these freedoms with so trivial an\\napplication of its power , can just as easily giv e us other simple capabilities which we can apply to the\\ndevelopment and use of different types  of structure from what we used to use.

Y ou are used to seeing a statement\\nportrayed in just the manner y ou might hear it —as a serial succession of words. But, just as with the\\nstatements within an argument, the conceptual relationship among the words of a sentence is not gener ally\\nserial, and we can benefit in matching better to the conceptual structure if we can con veniently work with\\ncertain non-serial symbol-structuring forms within sentences. 3b6o\\n\"Most of the structuring forms I\\'ll show y ou stem from the simple capabilit y of being able to establish arbitr ary\\nlinkages between different substructures, and of directing the computer subsequently to displa y a set of\\nlinked substructures with an y relativ e positioning we might designate among the different substructures.

When we had established the antecedent links for all the statements in the argument, the\\nquestion \\'So what?\\' that y ou might ask when looking at a giv en statement would be answered b y looking for\\nthe statements for which the giv en statement w as an antecedent. W e already ha ve links to these consequents\\n—just turn around the arrows on the antecedent links and we ha ve consequent links. So we can easily call\\nforth an uncluttered displa y of consequent statements to help us see wh y we needed this giv en statement in\\nthe argument. 3b6x\\n\"To help us get better comprehension of the structure of an argument, we can also call forth a schematic or\\ngraphical displa y. Once the antecedent -consequent links ha ve been established, the computer can\\nautomatically construct such a displa y for us.\" So , Joe spent a few minutes (with y our help) establishing a\\nreasonable set of links among the statements y ou had originally listed. Then another k eyed-in request to the\\ncomputer , and almost instantaneously there appeared a network of lines and dots that look ed something lik e\\na tree—ex cept that sometimes br anches would fuse together . \"Each node or dot represents one of the\\nstatements of y our argument, and the lines are antecedent -consequent links.

There ma y be man y levels\\nof substructuring between the lev el of individual symbols and that represented b y the entire collection. Y ou\\nand I ha ve been working with some of the lower -ordered substructures—the individual statements and the\\nmultistatement arguments— and ha ve skimmed through some of the w ays to build and manipulate them. The\\nresults of small arguments are usually integr ated in a higher lev el network of argument or concept\\ndevelopment, and these into still higher -level networks, and so on. But at an y such lev el, the manner in which\\nthe interrelationship between the k ernels of argument can be tagged, portr ayed, studied and manipulated is\\nmuch the same as those which we ha ve just been through. 3b7a\\n\"Substructures that might represent mathematical or formal-logic arguments ma y be link ed right in with\\nsubstructures composed of the more informal statements. Substructures that represent gr aphs, curv es,\\nengineering dr awings, and other gr aphical forms can lik ewise be integr ated. One can also append special\\nsubstructures, of an y size, to particular other substructures. A frequent use of this is to append descriptiv e\\nmaterial—something lik e footnotes, only much more flexible. Or , special messages can be hung on that offer\\nideas such as simplif ying an argument or circum venting a block ed path—to be unco vered and considered at\\nsome later date. These different appended substructures can remain in visible to the work er until such time as\\nhe wants to flush them into view . He can ask for the cue symbols that indicate their presence (identif ying\\nwhere they are link ed and what their respectiv e types are) to be shown on the network displa y any time he\\nwishes, and then call up whichev er of them he wishes If he is interested in only one t ype of appended\\nsubstructure, he can request that only the cues associated with that t ype be displa yed. 3b7b\\n\"You should also realiz e that a substructure doesn\\'t ha ve to be a hunk of data sitting neatly distinct within the\\nnormal form of the larger structure.

W ell, more of the displa y look ed meaningful to y ou than when y ou had first w atched him\\ngoing about his work, but y ou realiz ed that y ou were still a bit uneducated. I\\'v e dev eloped a sequence for\\npresenting the different basic features of our augmentation system that seems to work prett y well, and I just\\nwanted to be sure I w as still following it reasonably closely .\" 3b8a\\nHe noticed y ou wrinkle y our face as y ou look ed at the displa y. \"It\\'s time to shift the topic a bit, and some of\\nthe things on the screen that are probably puzzling y ou can mak e a starting point for a new discussion phase.\\nSee, when I outlined a deliv ery for giving a feel for these techniques to the uninitiated, I could ha ve sketched\\nout the subject matter in a sk eletal argument structure. From what we\\'v e been through so far , you might\\nexpect it to be lik e that. What I did, though, w as to treat the matter as a process that I w as going to ex ecute\\nthe process of giving y ou a lecture demonstr ation. It is a r ather trivial ex ercise of the techniques we ha ve for\\ndeveloping and manipulating processes, but an yway that\\'s the form I chose for making the notes. 3b8b\\n\"A process is something that is designed, built, and used— as is an y tool. In the gener al sense in which we\\nconsider processes to be a part of our augmentation system, it is absolutely necessary that there be effectiv e\\ncapabilit y for designing and building processes as well as for using them. F or one thing, the la ying out of\\nobjectiv es and a method of approach for a problem represent a form of process design and building, to our\\nway of looking at it. And an independent problem solv er certainly has to ha ve this capabilit y. Indeed, we find\\nthat designing and coordinating one\\'s sequence of steps, in high lev els or in low lev els of such process\\nstructuring , is an extremely important part of the total activit y. 3b8c\\n\"One of our research guys in the early phases of our augmentation dev elopment w as considered (then) to be\\na bug on this topic.

Well, we can\\'t analyz e the\\nold w ays of doing things v ery accur ately to check his estimated figures, but we certainly ha ve come to be in\\ngener al sympath y with his stand. W e have dev eloped quite a few concepts and methods for using the\\ncomputer system to help us plan and supervise sophisticated courses of action, to monitor and ev aluate what\\nwe do , and to use this information as direct feedback for modif ying our planning techniques in the future. 3b8d\\n\"There are, of course, the explicit computer processes which we use, and which our philosoph y requires the\\naugmented man to be able to design and build for himself . A number of people, outside our research group\\nhere, maintain stoutly that a pr actical augmentation system should not require the human to ha ve to do an y\\ncomputer progr amming—they feel that this is too specializ ed a capabilit y to burden people with. W ell, what\\nthat means in our ey es, if tr anslated to a home workshop , would be lik e saying that y ou can\\'t require the\\noperating human to know how to adjust his tools, or set up jigs, or change drill siz es, and the lik e. You can\\nsee there that these skills are easy to learn in the context of what the human has to learn an yway about using\\nthe tools, and that they pro vide for much greater flexibilit y in finding con venient w ays to use the tools to help\\nshape materials. 3b8e\\n\"It won\\'t tak e too much time to giv e you a feel for the helpful methods we ha ve for working on computer -\\nprocess structures—or progr ams—because there is quite a bit of similarit y in concept to what y ou ha ve seen\\nin the symbol-structuring techniques. No matter what language  you use— whether machine language, list\\nlanguage, or AL GOL, for instance— you build up the required process structure b y organizing statements in\\nthat language. Each statement specifies a giv en process to y our computer . Well, you ha ve already seen how\\nyou can get help in dev eloping precise and powerful statements, or in gaining quick comprehension of\\nstatements, b y charting or diagr amming them and using special links between the different parts. \"Look\\nhere.\\'\" And he went after what he said w as a t ypical process structure, to giv e you an example of what he\\nwas talking about.

But, what he finally\\nhad on the displa y frame w as quite different from the argument statements y ou had seen. 3b8f\\n\"In explaining symbol-structuring to y ou, I used the lik ely questions, \\'What\\'s this?\\' \\'How come?\\' and \\'So\\nwhat?\\' to point out the usefulness of some of our structuring methods.

But this portr ayal\\ndoesn\\'t stem from special appended information, it can be laid out lik e this automatically b y the computer ,\\njust from the cues it gets from the necessary symbol components of the statement. The different significant\\nrelationships are more perceptible to a human in this w ay of la ying it out, and an experienced human thus\\ngets quite a bit of help in answering the first question: \\'What does it sa y to do?\\' 3b8h\\nFor the second question, relativ e to what effect the specified action will ha ve, some of these symbols to the\\nright giv e you a quick story about the v ery detailed and immediate effect on the state of the symbol structure\\nwhich this process structure is manipulating. Other symbols here pro vide k eys which a light -pen selection can\\nactivate to bring to y ou displa ys of that symbol structure, usually a choice of sev eral relev ant views at\\ndifferent lev els of the structure. Then I can use the k eyset to ask for the preceding statement, if I\\'m a little\\npuzzled about the detailed manipulation—or , I can request a specific higher -level view of the process structure\\nby light -pen selection on one of these remaining symbols here. 3b8i\\nSo sa ying, Joe selected one of these symbols with his pen, and a new and different displa y popped into view .\\n\"This is the next lev el up in the process structure. It consists of lists of compactly abbreviated statements,\\nand some condensed notes about their effects. If we w ant, we can blow up one at a time as we study o ver the\\nlist. In this context, one can get some answer to the larger picture of what effect will a giv en statement ha ve,\\nand also some answer to the question about wh y we w ant a giv en effect produced. But this is a sort of a\\nholdo ver from old progr amming habits, and most of us now adays are making consider ably more use of the\\nschematic techniques that ev olved out of the progr am flow -charting techniques and out of our symbol-\\nstructuring techniques. 3b8j\\n\"I know that y ou ha ve less previous familiarit y with the nature of progr ams than y ou do with the nature of\\narguments, so I\\'ll just giv e you a few quick views of what these process-structure schematic portr ayals look\\nlike, and not try to explain them in an y detail.

Y ou could appreciate some of the tricks of linking in\\nexplanatory and descriptiv e substructure and the gener al means of using all the different symbol-structuring\\ntricks for representing to the human the consider ations, critical features, and interdependencies in volved in\\nthe process structure. 3b8k\\n\"Most of this portr ayal technique actually represents special structuring of what we previously defined in a\\nloose w ay as arguments.

Y ou sa w how this could be facilitated b y our symbol-structuring techniques. And if he is building\\na new process structure or changing an existing one, he needs to structure the argument or reasoning behind\\nthe design. W e have dev eloped a number of special symbol-structuring techniques that allow us to match\\nespecially well to the concepts in volved in designing processes. 3b8l\\n\"But there is a v ery significant feature in volved in this particular t ype of process structuring that I should tell\\nyou about. It is based upon the fact that the process-description language for the computer is formal and\\nprecise. Because of this fact, we can establish explicit rules for treating statements in this language, and for\\ntreating symbol structures composed of these statements, such that computer processes based upon these\\nrules can be said to extr act meaning from these statements and to do oper ations based upon this meaning.\\nThe result is that the computer is able to find answers to a much wider r ange of questions about a specified\\nprocess structure than it could if only the structur al char acteristics were discernible to it. 3b8m\\n\"In our studying and designing process structures, we ha ve found man y ways to capitaliz e upon this more\\nsophisticated question- answering capabilit y now possessed b y the computer . We are learning, for instance,\\nhow to get the computer to decide whether or not some t ypes of design specifications are met, and if not,\\nwhere the limitation exists. Or , perhaps we approach an already designed process structure which we think we\\ncan modif y, or from which we can extr act some useful sub-process that we contemplate incorpor ating into\\nanother process we are designing. W e are getting terrific help in this t ype of instance, since we can now ask\\nthe computer direct questions about t ypes of capabilit y and limitation in this structure. The computer can\\neven lead us directly to the particular design features from which these capabilities or limitations stem, and it\\nis simple then to examine the descriptiv e and explanatory arguments link ed thereto in order to see wh y these\\nfeatures were designed into the structure. 3b8n\\n\"But I don\\'t w ant to spend a disproportionate amount of time on the computer processes. The augmented\\nman is engaged more often in structuring what we call composite processes than he is in structuring\\ncomputer processes. F or instance, planning a research project, or a da y\\'s work, are examples of structuring\\ncomposite processes. A composite process, remember , is organiz ed from both human processes and computer\\nprocesses— which includes, of course, the possible inclusion of lower -order composite processes. The\\nstructuring here differs from that of a computer process mainly in the sophistication of the sub-processes\\nwhich can be specified  for the human to do . Some of these specifications ha ve to be giv en in a language\\nwhich matches the human\\'s rich working fr amework of concepts— and we ha ve been demonstr ating here with\\nEnglish for that purpose—but quite a few human-ex ecuted processes can be specified  in the high-lev el\\ncomputer -processing language ev en though we don\\'t know how to describe  them in that language. This\\nmeans that there are quite a few composite-process structures about which the computer can answer v ery\\nuseful questions for us. 3b8o', metadata={'source': './assets-resources/Augmenting-Human-Intellect_ A-Conceptual-Framework-1962-Doug Engelbart.pdf', 'page': 68}),\n",

We mentioned abo ve what the char acteristic structur al difference w as between\\ncomputer processes and composite processes. But perhaps more important to us is the difference in the w ay\\nwe work with composite-process structures. Here is a crude but succinct w ay to put this. With the human\\ncontributing to a process, we find more and more as the process becomes complex that the v alue of the\\nhuman\\'s contribution depends upon how much freedom he is giv en to be disorderly in his course of action. F or\\ninstance, we pro vide him as much help as possible in making a plan of action. Then we giv e him as much help\\nas we can in carrying it out. But we also ha ve to allow him to change his mind at almost an y point, and to\\nwant to modif y his plans. So , we pro vide augmentation help to him for k eeping tr ack of his plans where he is\\nin them, what has been happening in carrying them out to date— and for ev aluating possibilities that might\\noccur to him for changing the plans. In fact, we are ev en learning how the computer can be made to w atch\\nfor some kinds of plan-change possibilities, and to point them out to the human when they arise. 3b8p\\n\"Here\\'s a simple example of this sort of help for the human. Last winter , we designed a computer process that\\ncan automatically monitor the occurrence of specified t ypes of computer usage o ver a specified period of time,\\nand which, from the resulting data, can deduce a surprising amount of information regarding how the human\\nmade use of that time. This w as quite helpful to us for ev aluating our w ays of doing things. Then we added\\nmore features to the progr am, in which the computer occasionally interrupts the human\\'s activit y and displa ys\\nsome questions to be answered. From these answers, together with its normal monitoring data, the progr am\\ncan pro vide ev aluativ e data regarding the relativ e success of his different work methods. Our augmentation\\nresearchers became intrigued b y this angle and bore down a little on it. They came up with a package process\\nwhich giv es the human man y different t ypes of feedback about his progress and w ay of doing things. Now , as\\npart of m y regular pr actice, I spend about fiv e minutes out of each hour ex ercising with this package. This\\nalmost alw ays rev eals things to me that change at least the slant of m y approach during the next hour , and\\noften stimulates a relativ ely significant change in m y short -range plans. 3b8q\\n\"You appreciate, of course, that I accomplish man y more meaningful steps in an hour now than I used to , or\\nthan would be y our norm now . This once- an-hour review for me now might compare with a once- a-day review\\nfor you, as far as the distance tr avelled between reviews is concerned. 3b8r\\n\"Our w ay of structuring the statement of our objectiv es, the arguments which lead to the design of our plans,\\nand the working statements of our plans, has been influenced b y this review process.

But we ha ve taken to linking special tagging codes into these argument structures in volving our\\nplanning, to identif y for the computer some of the different t ypes of dependency relationships in the\\nantecedent linkages. Later , if we consider changing the plan, these special tags often enable us to mak e use\\nof some special computer processes that automatically isolate the consider ations relev ant to a particular t ype\\nof change we ha ve in mind. 3b8s\\n\"Maybe an example will help here. There is a plan I am currently using for the w ay I go about entering\\nmiscellaneous scr aps of information into m y total symbol structure. It is designed so that there will be a good\\nchance for these scr aps later to be usefully integr ated. It turns out that this plan is closely coupled in its\\ndesign argument to the gener al plan for reviewing process structures— and symbol-structures, too , for that\\nmatter . Recently , I got an idea as to how I might add a little feature to that process that specially suited m y\\nparticular w ay of w anting to deal with miscellaneous thoughts that I get. By v arious means, I v ery quickly\\nlearned that this would be easy to do if I could but rev erse the order in which I ex ecute the sub-process Steps\\nA and B , when I enter a piece of information. I had to find out if I could safely rev erse their order without\\ngetting into trouble someplace in m y system. 3b8t\\n\"This I could do relativ ely rapidly , by your standards, b y snooping down the antecedent tr ails, looking for\\nstatements relev ant to this timing question. There is, in fact, a semi- automatic processes a vailable to me for\\nspeeding just such searches. The computer k eeps tr ack of where I ha ve look ed, where I\\'v e mark ed things as\\nyes, or no , or possible, and does the bookk eeping and calculating necessary to guide me through an optimum\\nsearch str ategy . But the special tagging we do when we mak e a process structure lets this search be fully\\nautomatic when certain kinds of relationships are in volved—and relativ e timing happens to be one of these\\nrelationships. 3b8u\\n\"So I phr ased a question which essentially ask ed for consider ations relev ant to the order in which these two\\nsteps were ex ecuted, and turned the computer loose. It took about three seconds for the results to be\\nforthcoming— you ha ven\\'t y et seen me request a task that took a noticeable period of machine time, ha ve\\nyou? But an yway, the computer disco vered a relev ance tr ail that ended up showing that rev ersing the order of\\nSteps A and B during the information-scr ap entry process would cripple a certain feature in the planning-\\nreview process, where miscellaneous thoughts and possibilities are gleaned from this store to be considered\\nrelativ e to the planning. 3b8v\\n\"But let\\'s try to back a way from details for a bit, now , and see if we can get a feeling for the significance of\\nthe things we\\'v e been talking about.

It is an intellectual one, where the\\nprocessing and shaping done is of conceptual material r ather than ph ysical material. But between these two\\ntypes of working domains we nonetheless find closely analogous conditions relativ e to the v ariety and\\nsophistication of the processes and techniques applicable to what nonroutine work ers do . Consider the\\nintellectual domain of a creativ e problem solv er, and listen to me r attle off the names of some specializ ed\\ndisciplines that come to mind. These esoteric disciplines could v ery possibly contribute specializ ed processes\\nand techniques to a gener al work er in the intellectual domain: F ormal logic —mathematics of man y varieties,\\nincluding statistics—decision theory —game theory —time and motion analysis—oper ations research—\\nclassification theory —documentation theory —cost accounting, for time, energy , or money —dynamic\\nprogr amming—computer progr amming. These are only a few of the total, I\\'m sure. 3b8ab\\n\"This implies the r ange of potentially applicable processes. R ealize that there is also a correspondingly large\\nlist of specializ ed materials potentially usable in the fabrications of the intellectual work er. I speak, of course,\\nabout the conceptual material in the man y different fields of human interest. The things that I ha ve been\\ndemonstr ating to y ou this afternoon were designed to increase significantly the r ange of both processes and\\nmaterials o ver which a human can pr actically oper ate within this intellectual domain. Y ou might sa y that we\\ndo this b y providing him with a v ery fast, agile v ehicle, equipped with all sorts of high-performance sensory\\nequipment and na vigational aids, and carrying v ery flexible, powerful, semi- automatic devices for oper ating\\nupon the materials of this domain. Not only that, but to pro vide an accur ate analogy , we ha ve to giv e him a\\ncomputer to help him organiz e and monitor his activit y and assess his results. W e get direct help on man y\\nlevels of activit y in our system, y ou see. 3b8ac\\n\"But back to the topic of tools, and the analogy of the in ventor who w as giv en the equipment and the helper .\\nOur augmented intellectual work er gets essentially this same kind of service, only more so— a compounding of\\nthis kind of service. Structuring our processes with care and precision enables the computer to answer limited\\nquestions, to guide y ou to relev ant descriptions and specifications within its structure, to ex ecute complex but\\nlimited-gr asp processes on its own, and to tak e care of complex rule and procedure-following bookk eeping in\\nguiding the ex ecution of sophisticated composite processes. This actually mak es it pr actical to use man y\\nspecializ ed processes and techniques from v ery esoteric fields—to assess their applicabilit y and limitations\\nquickly , to incorpor ate them intelligently into the design and analysis of possible courses of action, and to\\nexecute them efficiently . 3b8ad\\n\"Our specializ ed processes represent a beautiful collection of special tools.

Furthermore, we are pro vided with other tools that help us determine the applicabilit y of these tools b y\\nautomatically oper ating upon the instruction manual for us.

Our shop contains\\nan efficient tool-making section, where we can design and build our own tools from scr atch, or b y\\nincorpor ating parts or all of an y other tools we ha ve. 3b8ae\\n\"Let me tell y ou of an interesting feature stemming from m y using such impro ved Process-structuring\\ntechniques. An effectiv e job of breaking down a complex problem into humanly manageable steps— and this is\\nessentially what we seek in our process structuring— will pro vide the human with something to do at ev ery\\nturn. This ma y be to ponder or go searching, true enough— we aren\\'t sa ying that the steps are necessarily\\nstraightforw ard. But the point I w ant to mak e is that no longer am I ev er at a loss as to what to do next. I get\\nstuck at times, to be sure, but when I do I ha ve clean and direct w ays to satisf y myself that I should just beat\\naway at that roadblock for the time being. 3b8af\\n\"And then, for beating a way at the roadblock, m y bookk eeping regarding what I\\'v e tried, what possibilities\\nI\\'ve collected, and what m y assumptions and objectiv es are, is good enough to help tremendously in k eeping\\nme from getting into loops and quandaries, in carefully exhausting possibilities, and in really analyzing m y\\nassumptions and objectiv es. What\\'s more, I\\'m not gener ating reams of cy clic arguments, lists, calculations, or\\nthe lik e—either I\\'m checking the v alidity of what I\\'v e already structured, or I am correcting or expanding the\\nstructure. In other words, it seems that the growth of m y comprehension is sure and steady up to the point at\\nwhich I succeed or giv e up. If I giv e up, I lea ve a structure which is v ery well organiz ed to accommodate a\\nsubsequent revisit with new data, possibilities, assumptions, objectiv es, or tools. Also , I set up a sentinel\\nprocess that will oper ate in the future to help alert me to concepts which ma y clear the block. 3b8ag\\n\"This feature, of alw ays ha ving satisf ying actions to perform, and ha ving a good feeling that they are what I\\nshould be doing at that time, giv es a surprisingly contented, eager , and absorbing fla vor to m y work. I guess\\nit\\'s an adult instance of the sort of change observ ed in students when they were giv en teaching machines that\\nprovided continuous participation and reinforcement. 3b8ah\\n\"Anyway, with the quick flexibilit y available to me for structuring arguments, and semi- automatic application\\nof special tagging and linking rules, I find it really quite easy to construct, use, or modif y sophisticated\\nprocess structuring. And I can turn right around and apply this tow ard impro ving m y abilit y for structuring\\narguments and processes. The initial, str aightforw ard capabilities for manipulating symbol structures, that\\nwere more or less obviously a vailed me b y the computer ha ve given to me a power to participate in more\\nsophisticated processes that capitaliz e more fully upon the computer\\'s capabilit y—processes which are v ery\\nsignificant to m y net effectiv eness, and y et which weren\\'t particularly apparent to us as either possible or\\nuseful in the da ys before we started harnessing computers to the human\\'s workada y activities in this direct\\nway.\\' 3b8ai', metadata={'source': './assets-resources/Augmenting-Human-Intellect_ A-Conceptual-Framework-1962-Doug Engelbart.pdf', 'page': 73}),\n",

Team Cooperation 3b9\\n\"Let me mention another bonus feature that w asn\\'t easily fore seen. W e have experimented with ha ving\\nseveral people work together from working stations that can pro vide inter -communication via their computer\\nor computers. That is, each person is equipped as I am here, with free access to the common working\\nstructures. There pro ves to be a really phenomenal boost in group effectiv eness o ver any previous form of\\ncooper ation we ha ve experienced. They can all work on the same symbol structure, wherev er they might\\nwish. If an y two w ant to work simultaneously on the same material, they simply duplicate and each starts\\nreshaping his v ersion— and later it is easy to merge their contributions. The whole team can join forces at a\\nmoment\\'s notice to \\'pull together\\' on some stubborn little problem, or to mak e a group decision. Most points\\nof contention are resolv ed quite natur ally, over a period of time, as the dev eloping structure of argument\\nbears out one, or the other , or neither stand. 3b9a\\n\"No one can dominate the show , since seldom do y ou ha ve to \\'listen\\' to the person concurrent to the\\ndevelopments he is pursuing— and y et at an y time another person can tune in on what he has done and is\\ndoing. One can either tak e immediate personal issue with another about some feature, an ywhere in the\\nstructure where he might find something done b y the other to which he w ants to tak e issue, or he can append\\nhis objection and the associated argument there where the disagreement lies, and tag this with a special cue\\nthat signals a point of contention that must ultimately be resolv ed. An y idea of the moment b y any member\\ncan easily be link ed to where it can do some good. It gets to be lik e a real whing-ding free-for -all—\\ntremendously stimulating and satisf ying, and things really get done. Y ou find y ourself \\'pla ying o ver your head\\'\\nalmost all of the time. 3b9b\\n\"We have been experimenting with multi-disciplinary teams and are becoming especially ex cited o ver the\\nresults. F or instance, there is a great reduction of the barrier that their different terminologies used to\\nrepresent, where one specialist couldn\\'t really apply his experience, intuition, or conceptual feel v ery well\\nunless the situation could be stated and fr amed in his accustomed manner , and y et the others couldn\\'t work\\nwith his terminology . Here, they meet at their concept and terminology interface and work out little shifts in\\nmeaning and use which each can find digestible in his system, and which permit quite precise definitions in\\neach system of the terms and concepts in the others. In studying the other\\'s structuring then, either of them\\ncan ha ve his own definitions automatically substituted for the other\\'s special terms. R educe this language\\nbarrier , and pro vide the feature of their being able to work in par allel independence on the joint structure, and\\nwhat seems to result is amplification of their different capabilities. 3b9c\\n\"Remember the term, synergesis, that has been associated in the liter ature with gener al structuring theory?\\nWell, here is something of an example.

It is a new and exhiliar ating experience to be working in this independent -parallel fashion with\\nsome good men. W e feel that the effect of these augmentation dev elopments upon group methods and group\\ncapabilit y is actually going to be more pronounced than the effect upon individuals methods and capabilities,\\nand we are v ery eager to increase our research effort in that direction.\" 3b9d\\n8.

But I ha ve selected the sample features to present to y ou with an ey e tow ard giving\\nyou a maximum chance to identif y these as being something significant to y our own t ype of work. I a voided\\ndiscussing techniques applicable to esoteric problem-solving processes— although some of them displa y\\nespecially stimulating possibilities to those with appropriate backgrounds. The abilit y to structure arguments\\norganiz ed in English-language statements, and to mak e use of the linking and tagging capabilities at all lev els\\nof the structure, can be seen to lead to man y interesting and promising new capabilities for organizing y our\\nthoughts and actions. I think y ou could picture learning these tricks and using them in y our own work. 3b10a\\n\"What I hoped to a void by presenting the system in this w ay, was losing y our identification with these\\npossibilities b y letting y ou get the mistak en impression that an individual couldn\\'t harness these techniques\\nusefully unless he first learned a lot of v ery sophisticated new language, logic and math. It is true that the\\nmore of the sophisticated tricks y ou learn, the more computer power y ou can harness and the more powerful\\nyou become—but v ery significant and personally thrilling pr actical problem-solving capabilities ha ve been\\ndeveloped b y quite a few subjects who were giv en only fifteen hours of tr aining at one of these stations. The\\ntraining, incidentally , was all pro vided b y the computer without the presence of a human instructor . And the\\npeople were of such div erse fields as sociology , biology , engineering management, applied mathematics, and\\nlaw. These were all relativ ely high-lev el people, and they were completely and unreserv edly unanimous in\\ntheir faith that their increased capabilit y would easily justif y the capital and oper ating outla y that we predicted\\nfor work stations of this sort in fiv e years, if the computer industry really were to tak e this t ype of potential\\nmarket seriously . 3b10b\\n\"What these people became capable of w as somewhat less than the r ange of capabilities that we ha ve\\ndiscussed so far —but they would find it v ery natur al to dev elop further techniques on their own, and new\\nteaching progr ams could be pro vided them so that they could continue learning the impro ved techniques\\nturned out b y a research group such as ours here. 3b10c\\n\"But let me giv e you a brief view of some of the more adv anced concepts and techniques that ha ve evolved\\nhere, compatible with, but bey ond, what I ha ve so far shown y ou.

But, as our means dev eloped\\nfor dealing with definitions and plans more precisely , easily , and flexibly , we began to realiz e that they in\\nreality might be the most significant part of that work. With our immensely increased capabilit y for complex\\nbookk eeping relativ e to our interlaced hier archies of objectiv es, plans, and arguments, we found that defining\\na new category , searching for members or instances of it, or applying its selection criteria were becoming ev er\\nconscious and specific tasks. 3b10e\\n\"For instance, we began to find it more and more useful to distinguish different categories or t ypes of process,\\ndifferent t ypes of arguments, different t ypes of relationships, and different t ypes of descriptions. F or a specific\\nexample, R anganathan*2* once cited fiv e specific relationships that could obtain between two terms, where\\none modifies the other . He called these phase  relations, and named how one term could relate to the other as\\neither biasing it, being a tool used to study it, being an aspect of it, being in comparison with it, or influencing\\nit. Vick ery ga ve more examples, sa ying one could also ha ve an effect on the other , be a cause of it, be a use\\nfor it, be a substitute for it, a source for it, an implication of it, be an explanation of it, or be a representation\\nof it. There are ev en more categories mentioned in the liter ature. 3b10f\\n\"It was easy to form tags and links, and we experimented with the gains to be made b y consciously specif ying\\nand indicating categories. It turned out to be a v ery in vigorating inno vation, and we began to tak e more pains\\nwith our structuring. It took longer to set up links and nodes in our structures, to be sure, but we found on\\nthe one hand that the structures became much cleaner and required fewer members, and on the other hand\\nthat we could get consider ably more sophisticated help from the computer in doing significant chores for us.\\n3b10g\\n\"We began to work up processes that would help us establish categories, giv e them good definitions,\\ncheck their relationship with other established categories, decide whether something fit a giv en category or\\nnot, search for all possible members of it within a giv en substructure, and so forth. The v ery fact of using this\\ncareful classification within our structures allowed us to get more powerful help from the computer in these\\nclassification processes. I should mention that the relationships among the terms in a sentence—the syntax if\\nyou wish—had been giv en further specification tags than those I showed y ou earlier , to remo ve ambiguities\\nthat hindered the computer from going back to a statement and resolving the syntactical structure. Also ,\\nambiguities in the meaning of the terms began to limit us, and we dev eloped methods for remo ving a good\\ndeal of this semantic ambiguit y.

It is hea vily dependent upon the v ery\\ncare in building structures that it so nicely facilitates, and also upon sev eral other dev elopments. One of these\\nother dev elopments stems from the concepts and techniques of the semantic differential, as first introduced\\nby Osgood, Suci, and T annenbaum*3* back in 1957, and from some subsequent work b y Mayer and Bagley*4*\\non what they called semantic models. These offered useful possibilities for establishing quite precisely what\\nmeaning a concept has to an individual, relativ e to his gener al conceptual fr amework, and for representing\\nthis meaning in a specific w ay that w as amenable to computer manipulation. 3b10i\\n\"The other dev elopment upon which this process to be exhibited is based, w as stimulated b y our realizing that\\nflexible cooper ation with the computer w as calling for lots of little inter actions. Our working repertoire of\\nsmall-task requests for computer service w as getting quite large, and it w as pro ving to be extremely v aluable\\nto use them and to be able to remember automatically their procedures and designation codes. One of our\\nresearch psy chologists had work ed on human-memory phenomena before he came with us, and had\\ninterested himself in mnemonic aids of all sorts. He has dev eloped some useful techniques for us to use in\\nconnection with this, and other problems. Now let me demonstr ate this example of an adv anced process for\\nhelping work with categories. 3b10j\\n\"Suppose that I w ant to establish a new category . Let\\'s sa y that I ha ve dev eloped its description in what y ou\\nand I ha ve been calling an argument structure. I w ant to giv e it a name— a short and meaningful one— and I\\nwant a good definition. In fact, I w ant a definition that the computer can later work with. Look, I\\'ll dig up a\\ndescription that is a waiting such a definition, and y ou can w atch what happens.\" So sa ying, Joe drummed on\\nhis keysets for a moment, with one interruption when the computer flashed something on the screen that w as\\napparently a question about what he w as asking the computer to find for him.

He studied it a moment, then look ed at the statements abo ve, pick ed out a node on\\nthe network with the pen, and hit the k eyset a few strok es.

Joe studied this, referred to the\\nstatements abo ve, flipped through sev eral lev els of network portr ayals, through a few statements\\nrepresenting a couple of low -level nodes, reflected a moment, and then pointed his light pen at a point on the\\ngraduated line, part w ay between the adjectiv es, and pressed its button. 3b10l\\n\"Actually , right now I\\'m demonstr ating a cooper ative process ex ecution technique.

The first term is a newly coined formal name, while the remaining three terms represent\\na compound expression, in volving established concepts, that can be used also as a designation of the new\\ncategory . The second line furnishes me with an association chain to use for a mnemonic aid in remembering\\nthe new name—linking the name to sev eral char acteristics of the concept. The name itself w as selected under\\nmnemonic criteria, as well as to ha ve a structure that goes with its syntactic and semantic categories. The\\nthird line lists the names of some previously defined categories or concepts that are the closest to this in\\nmeaning—these before the break were found to o verlap, and the rest are just close. 3b10n\\n\"The fourth line y ou recogniz e as a statement form, perhaps.

RESEARCH RECOMMENDA TIONS\\nA. OBJECTIVES FOR A RESEARCH PROGRAM 4a\\nThe report has put forth the h ypothesis that the intellectual effectiv eness of a human being is dependent upon\\nfactors which are subject to direct redesign in pursuit of an increase in that effectiv eness. A conceptual\\nframework is offered to help in giving consider ation to this h ypothesis, and an extensiv e and personaliz ed\\nprojection into possible future dev elopments is presented to help dev elop a feeling for the possibilities and\\npromise implicit in the h ypothesis and conceptual structure. 4a1\\nIf this h ypothesis and its glowing extr apolations were borne out in future dev elopments, the consequences would\\nbe most ex citing and assumedly beneficial to a problem-laden world. What is called for now is a test of this\\nhypothesis and a calibr ation on the gains if an y that might be realiz ed by giving total-system design attention to\\nhuman intellectual effectiv eness. If the test and calibr ation pro ved to be fa vorable, then we can set to work\\ndeveloping better and better augmentation systems for our problem solv ers. 4a2\\nIn this light, we recommend a research progr am approach aimed at (Goal 1) testing the h ypothesis, (Goal 2)\\ndeveloping the tools and techniques for designing better augmentation systems, and (Goal 3) producing real-\\nworld augmentation systems that bring maximum gains o ver the coming y ears to the solv ers of tough, critical', metadata={'source': './assets-resources/Augmenting-Human-Intellect_ A-Conceptual-Framework-1962-Doug Engelbart.pdf', 'page': 80}),\n",

These goals and the resulting design for their pursuit are idealiz ed, to be sure, but the results\\nnonetheless ha ve valuable aspects. 4a3\\nB. BASIC RESEARCH CONDITIONS 4b\\nThis should be an empirical approach on a total-system basis—i.e. , doing coordinated study and inno vation,\\namong all the factors admitted to the problem, in conjunction with experiments that pro vide realistic action and\\ninterpla y among these v ariables. The question of limiting these factors is considered later in the section. The\\nrecommended en vironment for this empirical, total-system approach, is a labor atory pro viding a computer -\\nbacked displa y and communication system of the gener al sort described in Section III -B. There should be no\\nstinting on the capabilities pro vided—it is v ery important to learn what v alue an y given artifact feature ma y offer\\nthe total system, and the only w ay to learn the v alue is to experiment with the feature. A t this point no time will\\nbe tak en to dev elop elabor ate impro vements in the art of time sharing, to pro vide real-time service to man y\\nusers. This kind of dev elopment should be done as separ ate, backup work. The experimental lab should tak e the\\nsteps that are immediately a vailable to pro vide all the service to the human that he needs in the experimental\\nenvironment. 4b1\\nWhere econom y demands that a computer not be idle during the time the augmented subject is not using it\\n(which would be a r ather large net fr action of the time, probably), and where sharing the computer with other\\nreal-time users for which demand dela ys are a problem, then the only sharing that should be considered is that\\nwith off -line computations for which there are no real-time service demands to be met. The computer can turn\\naway from off -line users whenev er the on-line work er needs attention of an y sort. 4b2\\nC. WHOM TO AUGMENT FIRST 4c\\nThe experimental work of deriving, testing, and integr ating inno vations into a growing system of augmentation\\nmeans must ha ve a specific t ype of human task to try to dev elop more effectiv eness for , to giv e unif ying focus to\\nthe research. W e recommend the particular task of computer progr amming for this purpose— with man y reasons\\nbehind the selection that should come out in the following discussion. Some of the more direct reasons are\\nthese: 4c1\\n1. The progr ammer works on man y problems, including large and realistic ones, which can be solv ed\\nwithout inter action with other humans. This eases the experimental problem. 4c1a\\n2.

Much of the progr ammer\\'s working data are computer progr ams (he also has, we assume, his own\\nreasoning and planning notes), which ha ve unambiguous syntactic and semantic form so that getting\\nthe computer to do useful tasks for him on his working data will be much facilitated— which helps v ery\\nmuch to get early experience on the v alue a human can deriv e from this kind of computer help . 4c1c\\n4. A progr ammer\\'s effectiv eness, relativ e to other progr ammers, can probably be measured more easily\\nthan would be the case for most other complex -problem solv ers.

Computer progr ammers are a natur al group to be the first in the \"real world\" to incorpor ate the t ype of\\naugmentation means we are considering.

This positiv e-feedback\\n(or regener ative) possibilit y deriv es from the facts that: (1) our researchers are dev eloping means to increase\\nthe effectiv eness of humans dealing with complex intellectual problems, and (2) our researchers are dealing with\\ncomplex intellectual problems. In other words, they are dev eloping better tools for a class to which they\\nthemselv es belong. If their initial work needs the unif ying focus of concentr ating upon a specific tool, let that tool\\nbe one important to them and whose impro vement will really help their own work. 4d1\\nE. TOOLS DEVELOPED AND TOOLS USED 4e\\nThis close similarit y between tools being dev eloped and the tools being used to do the dev eloping, calls for some\\ncare in our terminology if we w ant to a void confusion in our reasoning about their relationship . \"Augmentation\\nmeans\" will be used to name the tools being dev eloped b y the augmentation research. \"Subject Information\" will\\nbe used to refer to description and reasoning concerned with the subject of these tools (as opposed to the\\nmethod of research), and \"subject matter\" will refer to both subject information and ph ysical devices being\\nincorpor ated as artifacts in the augmentation means being dev eloped. \"T ools and techniques\" will be used to\\nname the tools being used to do that research, and are lik ely here to include special additions to language,\\nartifact, and methodology that particularly impro ve the special capabilities ex ercised in doing the research. 4e1\\nAn integr ated set of tools and techniques will represent an art of doing augmentation research. Although no such\\nart exists ready -made for our use, there are man y applicable or adaptable tools and techniques to be borrowed\\nfrom other disciplines. Psy chology , computer progr amming and ph ysical technology , displa y technology , artificial\\nintelligence, industrial engineering (e.g. , motion and time study), management science, systems analysis, and\\ninformation retriev al are some of the more lik ely sources. These disciplines also offer initial subject matter for\\nthe research. Because this kind of diagr amming can help more later on, we represent in Figure 3  the situation of\\nthe beginning research dr awing upon existing disciplines for subject matter and tools and techniques. 4e2\\nThe progr am begins with gener al dependence upon other , existing disciplines for its subject matter (solid arrow)\\nand its tools and techniques (dashed arrow).

Initial Augmentation-Research Program.4e3a\\nF. RESEARCH PLAN FOR ACTIVITY A 1 4f\\nThe dominant goal of Activit y A 1 (Goal 1, as in Fig 3) is to test our h ypothesis. Its gener al pursuit of\\naugmenting a progr ammer is designed to serv e this goal, but also to be setting the stage for later direct pursuit\\nof Goals 2 and 3 (i.e. , developing tools and techniques for augmentation research and producing real- world\\naugmentation systems). 4f1\\nBefore we discuss the possible subject matter through which this research might work, let us treat the matter of\\nits tools and techniques. Not too long ago we would ha ve recommended (and did), in the spirit of taking the\\nlong-r ange and global approach, that right from the beginning of a serious progr am of this sort there should be\\nestablished a careful and scientific methodology . Controlled experiments, with special re search subjects tr ained\\nand tested in the use of experimental new augmentation means, careful monitoring, record-k eeping, and\\nevaluativ e procedures, etc. This w as to be accompanied b y a thorough search through disciplines and careful\\nincorpor ation of useful findings. 4f2\\nStill in the spirit of the long-r ange and global sort of planning, but with a different outlook (based, among other\\nthings, upon an increased appreciation for the possibilities of capitalizing upon regener ation), we would now\\nrecommend that the approach be quite different. W e basically recommend A 1 research adhering to whatev er\\nformal methodology is required for (a) knowing when an impro vement in effectiv eness has been achiev ed, and\\n(b) knowing how to assign relative  value to the changes deriv ed from two competing inno vations. 4f3\\nBeyond this, and assuming dedication to the goal, reasonable maturit y, and plent y of energy , intelligence, and\\nimagination, we would recommend turning loose a group of four to six people (or a number of such groups) to', metadata={'source': './assets-resources/Augmenting-Human-Intellect_ A-Conceptual-Framework-1962-Doug Engelbart.pdf', 'page': 84}),\n",

By this second phase, enough has been\\nlearned about the trends and possibilities for this t ype of on-line man-computer cooper ation that some well-\\nbased guidance can be deriv ed for the t ypes of modifications and extensions to artifact capabilit y that would be\\nmost v aluable. Activit y A 2 could continue to deriv e long-r ange guidance for equipment dev elopment, perhaps\\ndeveloping labor atory inno vations in computers, displa y systems, stor age systems, or communication systems,\\nbut at least experimenting with the incorpor ation of the new artifact inno vations of others. 4g5\\nAn example of the t ype of guidance deriv ed from this research might be extr acted from the concepts discussed\\nin Section II -C-5 (Structure T ypes). We point out there that within the computer there might be built and\\nmanipulated symbol structures that represent better images of the concept structures of interest to the human\\nthan would an y symbol structure with which the human could work directly . To the human, the computer\\nrepresents a special instrument which can displa y to him a comprehensible image of an y char acteristic of this\\nstructure that ma y be of interest. From our conceptual viewpoint, this would be a source of tremendous power\\nfor the human to harness, but it depends upon the computer being able to \"read\" all of the stored information', metadata={'source': './assets-resources/Augmenting-Human-Intellect_ A-Conceptual-Framework-1962-Doug Engelbart.pdf', 'page': 87}),\n",

SUMMAR Y\\nThis report has treated one o ver-all view of the augmentation of human intellect. In the report the following things\\nhave been done: (1) An h ypothesis has been presented. (2) A conceptual fr amework has been constructed. (3) A\\n\"picture\" of augmented man has been described. (4) A research approach has been outlined. These aspects will be\\nre viewed here briefly: 5a\\n1. An hypothesis has been stated that the intellectual effectiv eness of a human can be significantly impro ved\\nby an engineering-lik e approach tow ard redesigning changeable components of a system. 5a1\\n2. A conceptual fr amework has been constructed that helps pro vide a w ay of looking at the implications and\\npossibilities surrounding and stemming from this h ypothesis. Briefly , this fr amework pro vides the realization\\nthat our intellects are already augmented b y means which appear to ha ve the following char acteristics: 5a2\\na. The principal elements are the language artifacts, and methodology that a human has learned to\\nuse. 5a2a\\nb. The elements are dynamically interdependent within an oper ating system. 5a2b\\nc. The structure of the system seems to be hier archical, and to be best considered as a hier archy of\\nprocess capabilities whose primitiv e components are the basic human capabilities and the functional', metadata={'source': './assets-resources/Augmenting-Human-Intellect_ A-Conceptual-Framework-1962-Doug Engelbart.pdf', 'page': 90}),\n",

The capabilities of prime interest are those associated with manipulating symbols and concepts in\\nsupport of organizing and ex ecuting processes from which are ultimately deriv ed human\\ncomprehension and problem solutions. 5a2d\\ne. The automation of the symbol manipulation associated with the minute-b y-minute mental processes\\nseems to offer a logical next step in the ev olution of our intellectual capabilit y. 5a2e\\n3. A picture of the implications and promise of this fr amework has been described, based upon direct human\\ncommunication with a computer . Here the man y ways in which the computer could be of service, at\\nsuccessiv e levels of augmented capabilit y, have been brought out. This picture is fanciful, but we believ e it\\nto be conserv ative and representativ e of the sort of rich and significant gains that are there to be pursued. 5a3\\n4. An approach has been outlined for testing the h ypothesis of Item (1) and for pursuing the \"rich and\\nsignificant gains\" which we feel are promised. This approach is designed to treat the redesign of a capabilit y\\nhierarchy by reworking from the bottom up , and y et to mak e the research on augmentation means progress\\nas fast as possible b y deriving pr actically usable augmentation systems for real- world problem solv ers at a\\nmaximum r ate. This goal is fostered b y the recommendation of incorpor ating positiv e feedback into the\\nresearch dev elopment —i.e., concentr ating a good share of the basic -research attention upon augmenting\\nthose capabilities in a human that are needed in the augmentation-research work ers. The real- world\\napplications would be pursued b y designing a succession of systems for specialists, whose progression\\ncorresponds to the increasing gener ality of the capabilities for which coordinated augmentation means ha ve\\nbeen ev olved. Consider ation is giv en in this r ather global approach to pro viding potential users in different\\ndomains of intellectual activit y with the basic gener al-purpose augmentation system from which they\\nthemselv es can construct the special features of a system to match their job , and their w ays of working—or\\nit could be used on the other hand b y researchers who w ant to pursue the dev elopment of special\\naugmentation systems for special fields. 5a4\\n6 VI.

The other contenders for first importance are all critically\\ndependent for their dev elopment and use upon this resource. An y possibilit y for ev olving an art or science that can\\ncouple directly and significantly to the continued dev elopment of that resource should w arrant doubly serious\\nconsider ation. 6b\\nSecond, the ideas presented are to be considered in both of the abo ve senses: the direct -development sense and\\nthe \"art of dev elopment\" sense. T o be sure, the possibilities ha ve long-term implications, but their pursuit and initial\\nrewards a wait us now . By our view , we do not  have to w ait until we learn how the human mental processes work,\\nwe do not  have to w ait until we learn how to mak e computers more \"intelligent\" or bigger or faster , we can begin\\ndeveloping powerful and economically feasible augmentation systems on the basis of what we now know and ha ve.\\nPursuit of further basic knowledge and impro ved machines will continue into the unlimited future, and will w ant to\\nbe integr ated into the \"art\" and its impro ved augmentation systems—but getting started now will pro vide not only\\norientation and stimulation for these pursuits, but will giv e us impro ved problem-solving effectiv eness with which to\\ncarry out the pursuits. 6c\\nThird, it becomes increasingly clear that there should be action now —the sooner the better —action in a number of\\nresearch communities and on an aggressiv e scale. W e offer a conceptual fr amework and a plan for action, and we\\nrecommend that these be considered carefully as a basis for action If they be considered but found unacceptable,\\nthen at least serious and continued effort should be made tow ard dev eloping a more acceptable conceptual\\nframework within which to view the o ver-all approach, tow ard dev eloping a more acceptable plan of action, or both.\\n6d\\nThis is an open plea to researchers and to those who ultimately motiv ate, finance, or direct them, to turn serious\\nattention tow ard the possibilit y of ev olving a dynamic discipline that can-treat the problem of impro ving intellectual\\neffectiv eness in a total sense. This discipline should aim at producing a continuous cy cle of impro vements—\\nincreased understanding of the problem, impro ved means for dev eloping new augmentation systems, and impro ved\\naugmentation systems that can serv e the world\\'s problem solv ers in gener al and this discipline\\'s work ers in\\nparticular . After all, we spend great sums for disciplines aimed at understanding and harnessing nuclear power . Why\\nnot consider dev eloping a discipline aimed at understanding and harnessing \"neur al power?\" In the long run, the\\npower of the human intellect is really much the more important of the two . 6e\\n7 ENDNO TES\\nSection I 7a\\n1. ^ Kennedy and Putt (see Ref. 1 in the list at the end of the report) bring out the importance of the conceptual\\nframework to the process of research.

      "According to Douglas Engelbart, augmentation refers to the use of computer-based systems to enhance or augment the intellectual capabilities of a human. This involves the development of language and methodology that can capitalize on the symbol-manipulating and portraying capabilities of computer-based equipment. The goal is to redesign the means of augmentation for an intellectually oriented, problem-solving human. This could involve new developments in concept, symbol, and process structuring to provide more powerful concepts and concept-manipulation techniques.\n"

      "QUERY:  What is the main purpose of the techniques and capabilities demonstrated by Joe in the essay?\n",
      "ANSWER The main purpose of the techniques and capabilities demonstrated by Joe in the essay is to show how a computerized system can augment human intellect by making the process of manipulating and organizing information more efficient and flexible. This includes tasks such as composing text, defining abbreviations, and rearranging and editing work. The system allows for rapid and dynamic changes, making it easier to develop and refine ideas. The essay emphasizes that these capabilities, while individually simple, can collectively lead to significant improvements in problem-solving and conceptual thinking.\n",
      "QUERY:  How does the computer system described in the essay assist in the manipulation and organization of symbol structures?\n",
      "ANSWER The computer system described in the essay assists in the manipulation and organization of symbol structures in several ways. Firstly, it allows for the representation of a given concept structure with a symbol structure that is compatible with the computer's internal way of handling symbols. This allows for a more accurate mapping of complex concept structures than what an individual could practically construct or use on paper.\n",
      "\n",
      "The computer can also transform back and forth between the two-dimensional portrayal on the screen and the aspect of the internal image that represents this \"view\". If the human adds to or modifies such a \"view\", the computer integrates the change into the internal-image symbol structure and can automatically detect a certain proportion of possible conceptual inconsistencies.\n",
      "\n",
      "The computer system also allows for the establishment of arbitrary linkages between different substructures and can display a set of linked substructures with any relative positioning designated among the different substructures. This can help in understanding the meaning of a statement or concept.\n",
      "\n",
      "Furthermore, the computer can manipulate symbols and generate their portrayals on a display, meaning the user doesn't need to concern themselves with how the information is stored. The computer can portray symbol structures that are consistent with the form in which the user thinks their information is structured.\n",
      "\n",
      "Finally, the computer can also transform one form of symbol structure into another with speed and flexibility, and can locate and portray new material quickly. This allows for a more efficient and flexible approach to problem-solving and concept structuring.\n",
      "QUERY:  What is the concept of an 'argument' as described in the essay?\n",
      "ANSWER In the essay, an 'argument' is referred to as any set of statements (termed 'product statements') that represents the outcome of a period of work towards a given objective. It is not necessarily a serial affair, but rather sequential, where some statements have to follow others. The essay describes an argument as a conceptual network rather than a conceptual chain. The essay also discusses the use of a computer system to visually represent an argument as a network of lines and dots, with each node representing a statement and the lines representing the antecedent-consequent links between statements. This visual representation can help in understanding the structure of an argument and how different ideas and reasoning fit together.\n",
      "QUERY:  How does the system help in structuring an argument and enhancing comprehension of complex concepts?\n",
      "ANSWER The system aids in structuring an argument and enhancing comprehension of complex concepts through several features. It allows users to break down sentences into different parts and position them in various places, with lines connecting them, similar to diagramming sentences in grammar studies. This can help users scan a complex statement and untangle it quickly. \n",
      "\n",
      "The system also allows users to link secondary phrases or sentences to parts of the main statement for more detailed descriptions. These secondary substructures don't appear when the statement is normally viewed, but can be brought in by simple request for closer study. \n",
      "\n",
      "When looking at a statement and asking 'How come?', users can use 'antecedent links' to point to previous statements that are significant to the understanding of the current statement. The system allows users to pick out the primary antecedents of the statement they are studying and establish links to them. \n",
      "\n",
      "The system also allows users to designate an order of \"importance to comprehension\" among these statements, and rearrange them accordingly. \n",
      "\n",
      "For better comprehension of the structure of an argument, the system can also provide a schematic or graphical display. Once the antecedent-consequent links have been established, the computer can automatically construct such a display. \n",
      "\n",
      "In summary, the system provides a variety of tools and methods to help users structure their arguments and enhance their understanding of complex concepts.\n",
      "QUERY:  What are some of the specific capabilities of the system that Joe demonstrates, such as in relation to text manipulation and linking of substructures?\n",
      "ANSWER Joe demonstrates several capabilities of the system related to text manipulation and linking of substructures. For text manipulation, he shows how he can type individual letters and numbers, with the computer automatically placing each successive symbol next to its predecessor, similar to a typewriter. The system also has an automatic \"carriage return\" feature. Additionally, Joe can call up dictionary definitions, synonyms, or antonyms for any word he has typed in with just a few quick actions. He can also define an abbreviation term for a group of words, which the computer associates with the group in its storage. Later, typing the abbreviation term will automatically display the entire group of words.\n",

      "In terms of linking substructures, Joe demonstrates how he can establish arbitrary linkages between different substructures. He can direct the computer to display a set of linked substructures with any relative positioning he might designate among the different substructures. He can also specify different types of links, which can lead to different display or manipulative treatments for the different types. Most links have a direction, like an arrow pointing from one substructure to another, so when setting up a link, he must specify the two substructures in a given order.\n"
