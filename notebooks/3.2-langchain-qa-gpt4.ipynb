      "QUERY:  Is this: The researchers used the data from the interviews to design the Athlete Readiness Form by identifying important mental constructs such as attentional focus and imagery from the interview transcripts. They then operationalized these constructs using terms and examples familiar to athletes. The format and questions of the form were based on their experience and qualitative analysis of the 75 interviews they conducted. The form comprised a series of questions, most of which invited both quantitative ratings and explanatory comments. the correct answer to this question: How did the researchers use the data from the interviews to design the Athlete Readiness Form? according to the paper?

      "QUERY:  Is this: According to the study, distraction control is a significant factor in the performance of athletes. The athletes who performed at their highest level consistently had excellent strategies for dealing with distractions or setbacks, allowing them to get back on track quickly when things didn't go well. Those who were less consistent in their performance appeared to need more work in this area to improve the consistency of their high level performance. The study suggests that on-site focus, which includes the ability to control distractions, is an extremely powerful variable affecting performance and is considered the most important index of the degree to which an athlete has integrated or automated mental control procedures. the correct answer to this question: What is the significance of distraction control in the performance of the athletes according to the study? according to the paper?
