The input consists of\\nqueries and keys of dimension dk, and values of dimension dv. We compute the dot products of the\\nquery with all keys, divide each by√dk, and apply a softmax function to obtain the weights on the\\nvalues.\\nIn practice, we compute the attention function on a set of queries simultaneously, packed together\\ninto a matrix Q. The keys and values are also packed together into matrices KandV. We compute\\nthe matrix of outputs as:\\nAttention( Q, K, V ) = softmax(QKT\\n√dk)V (1)\\nThe two most commonly used attention functions are additive attention [ 2], and dot-product (multi-\\nplicative) attention. Dot-product attention is identical to our algorithm, except for the scaling factor\\nof1√dk. Additive attention computes the compatibility function using a feed-forward network with\\na single hidden layer. While the two are similar in theoretical complexity, dot-product attention is\\nmuch faster and more space-efficient in practice, since it can be implemented using highly optimized\\nmatrix multiplication code.\\nWhile for small values of dkthe two mechanisms perform similarly, additive attention outperforms\\ndot product attention without scaling for larger values of dk[3]. We suspect that for large values of\\ndk, the dot products grow large in magnitude, pushing the softmax function into regions where it has\\nextremely small gradients4. To counteract this effect, we scale the dot products by1√dk.\\n3.2.2 Multi-Head Attention\\nInstead of performing a single attention function with dmodel-dimensional keys, values and queries,\\nwe found it beneficial to linearly project the queries, keys and values htimes with different, learned\\nlinear projections to dk,dkanddvdimensions, respectively. On each of these projected versions of\\nqueries, keys and values we then perform the attention function in parallel, yielding dv-dimensional\\n4To illustrate why the dot products get large, assume that the components of qandkare independent random\\nvariables with mean 0and variance 1.

       " 'answer': 'The main contribution of the paper is the introduction of the Transformer architecture, which is based solely on attention mechanisms, eliminating the need for recurrence and convolutions. This new architecture demonstrates superior performance in machine translation tasks, achieving state-of-the-art BLEU scores while being more parallelizable and requiring significantly less training time. Additionally, the Transformer generalizes well to other tasks, such as English constituency parsing.'}"

    "Let's start with the server.py file:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "The script you've provided sets up a basic web server using FastAPI, a popular framework for building APIs with Python. It's designed to be fast and easy to use, with automatic data validation and interactive API documentation. The script also includes integration for LangChain (`langserve` module), which seems to be a library for adding language model-related functionalities, such as retrieval-augmented generation (RAG). Here's a detailed breakdown of each part of the script:\n",
    "\n",
    "### Imports\n",
    "```python\n",
    "from fastapi import FastAPI\n",
    "from fastapi.responses import RedirectResponse\n",
    "from langserve import add_routes\n",
    "```\n",
    "- **`FastAPI`**: Imports the FastAPI class, which is used to create the API server.\n",
    "- **`RedirectResponse`**: Imports a helper from FastAPI for issuing HTTP redirects.\n",
    "- **`add_routes`**: Imports a function from the `langserve` package, which presumably adds specific routes to the FastAPI app related to language processing services.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Initialize the FastAPI Application\n",
    "```python\n",
    "app = FastAPI()\n",
    "```\n",
    "- This line initializes a new FastAPI application. `app` is now an instance of `FastAPI` and will be used to register routes and run the server.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Root Route\n",
    "```python\n",
    "@app.get(\"/\")\n",
    "async def redirect_root_to_docs():\n",
    "    return RedirectResponse(\"/docs\")\n",
    "```\n",
    "- `@app.get(\"/\")`: This is a route decorator provided by FastAPI. It tells FastAPI that the function directly below should be executed when an HTTP GET request is made to the root URL (`\"/\"`).\n",
    "- `async def redirect_root_to_docs()`: Defines an asynchronous function that handles requests to the root URL.\n",
    "- `return RedirectResponse(\"/docs\")`: The function returns a `RedirectResponse` object, which redirects the client to the `/docs` URL. FastAPI automatically generates interactive API documentation (using Swagger UI), accessible at `/docs`. This redirect is a convenience to lead users directly to the documentation.\n",
    "\n",
    "### LangChain Routes Integration\n",
    "```python\n",
    "# Edit this to add the chain you want to add\n",
    "add_routes(app, NotImplemented)\n",
    "```\n",
    "- This line suggests that `add_routes` function is meant to extend the FastAPI application (`app`) with additional routes or functionalities related to LangChain.\n",
    "    - What `add_routes` does is it connects the chain to our app exposing the methods of the chain to our web server.\n",
    "- The second argument `NotImplemented` seems to be a placeholder. In practice, you would replace `NotImplemented` with an actual implementation or configuration that specifies what routes or features from LangChain should be integrated into the FastAPI application.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Main Execution Block\n",
    "```python\n",
    "if __name__ == \"__main__\":\n",
    "    import uvicorn\n",
    "    uvicorn.run(app, host=\"0.0.0.0\", port=8000)\n",
    "```\n",
    "- `if __name__ == \"__main__\"`: This is a common Python idiom. It checks if the script is being run as the main program (not imported as a module in another script) and only then executes the code block inside it.\n",
    "- `import uvicorn`: Imports `uvicorn`, an ASGI server for running FastAPI applications. It's specifically designed to work well with asynchronous applications and is highly performant.\n",
    "- `uvicorn.run(app, host=\"0.0.0.0\", port=8000)`: This line starts the `uvicorn` server with the FastAPI app. The `host=\"0.0.0.0\"` configuration tells the server to listen on all network interfaces, making the server accessible externally. `port=8000` specifies the network port for the server.\n",
    "\n",
    "Overall, this script sets up a basic FastAPI application, redirects the root URL to automatically generated API documentation, and integrates (though in a placeholder manner) additional routes via a `langserve` library for handling specific language model tasks."

       "   Document(page_content='1 Introduction\\nRecurrent neural networks, long short-term memory [ 13] and gated recurrent [ 7] neural networks\\nin particular, have been firmly established as state of the art approaches in sequence modeling and\\ntransduction problems such as language modeling and machine translation [ 35,2,5]. Numerous\\nefforts have since continued to push the boundaries of recurrent language models and encoder-decoder\\narchitectures [38, 24, 15].\\nRecurrent models typically factor computation along the symbol positions of the input and output\\nsequences. Aligning the positions to steps in computation time, they generate a sequence of hidden\\nstates ht, as a function of the previous hidden state ht−1and the input for position t. This inherently\\nsequential nature precludes parallelization within training examples, which becomes critical at longer\\nsequence lengths, as memory constraints limit batching across examples. Recent work has achieved\\nsignificant improvements in computational efficiency through factorization tricks [ 21] and conditional\\ncomputation [ 32], while also improving model performance in case of the latter. The fundamental\\nconstraint of sequential computation, however, remains.\\nAttention mechanisms have become an integral part of compelling sequence modeling and transduc-\\ntion models in various tasks, allowing modeling of dependencies without regard to their distance in\\nthe input or output sequences [ 2,19]. In all but a few cases [ 27], however, such attention mechanisms\\nare used in conjunction with a recurrent network.\\nIn this work we propose the Transformer, a model architecture eschewing recurrence and instead\\nrelying entirely on an attention mechanism to draw global dependencies between input and output.\\nThe Transformer allows for significantly more parallelization and can reach a new state of the art in\\ntranslation quality after being trained for as little as twelve hours on eight P100 GPUs.\\n2 Background\\nThe goal of reducing sequential computation also forms the foundation of the Extended Neural GPU\\n[16], ByteNet [ 18] and ConvS2S [ 9], all of which use convolutional neural networks as basic building\\nblock, computing hidden representations in parallel for all input and output positions. In these models,\\nthe number of operations required to relate signals from two arbitrary input or output positions grows\\nin the distance between positions, linearly for ConvS2S and logarithmically for ByteNet. This makes\\nit more difficult to learn dependencies between distant positions [ 12]. In the Transformer this is\\nreduced to a constant number of operations, albeit at the cost of reduced effective resolution due\\nto averaging attention-weighted positions, an effect we counteract with Multi-Head Attention as\\ndescribed in section 3.2.\\nSelf-attention, sometimes called intra-attention is an attention mechanism relating different positions\\nof a single sequence in order to compute a representation of the sequence. Self-attention has been\\nused successfully in a variety of tasks including reading comprehension, abstractive summarization,\\ntextual entailment and learning task-independent sentence representations [4, 27, 28, 22].\\nEnd-to-end memory networks are based on a recurrent attention mechanism instead of sequence-\\naligned recurrence and have been shown to perform well on simple-language question answering and\\nlanguage modeling tasks [34].\\nTo the best of our knowledge, however, the Transformer is the first transduction model relying\\nentirely on self-attention to compute representations of its input and output without using sequence-\\naligned RNNs or convolution. In the following sections, we will describe the Transformer, motivate\\nself-attention and discuss its advantages over models such as [17, 18] and [9].\\n3 Model Architecture\\nMost competitive neural sequence transduction models have an encoder-decoder structure [ 5,2,35].\\nHere, the encoder maps an input sequence of symbol representations (x1, ..., x n)to a sequence\\nof continuous representations z= (z1, ..., z n). Given z, the decoder then generates an output\\nsequence (y1, ..., y m)of symbols one element at a time. At each step the model is auto-regressive\\n[10], consuming the previously generated symbols as additional input when generating the next.\\n2', metadata={'page': 1, 'source': './paper.pdf'})]},\n",
