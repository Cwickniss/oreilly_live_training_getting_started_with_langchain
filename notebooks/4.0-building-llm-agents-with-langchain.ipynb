    "- Chains and agents represent two concepts in technology with distinct functionalities. Chains refer to linear sequences of events or processes that rely on the step-by-step execution of tasks, often requiring predefined inputs and producing predictable outcomes. \n",
    "\n",
    "- Agents, conversely, are autonomous systems capable of making decisions and performing tasks independently, adapting to new situations without explicit instructions. While chains excel in structured environments with clear rules, agents are designed to navigate complex, dynamic scenarios, learning and adjusting their behavior over time. The core difference lies in the level of autonomy and complexity each can handle, with agents typically seen as more advanced due to their self-governing nature."
