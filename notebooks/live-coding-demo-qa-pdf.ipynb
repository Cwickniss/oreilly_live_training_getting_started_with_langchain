       " Document(metadata={'source': './paper.pdf', 'page': 1}, page_content='1 Introduction\\nRecurrent neural networks, long short-term memory [ 13] and gated recurrent [ 7] neural networks\\nin particular, have been firmly established as state of the art approaches in sequence modeling and\\ntransduction problems such as language modeling and machine translation [ 35,2,5]. Numerous\\nefforts have since continued to push the boundaries of recurrent language models and encoder-decoder\\narchitectures [38, 24, 15].\\nRecurrent models typically factor computation along the symbol positions of the input and output\\nsequences. Aligning the positions to steps in computation time, they generate a sequence of hidden\\nstates ht, as a function of the previous hidden state ht−1and the input for position t. This inherently\\nsequential nature precludes parallelization within training examples, which becomes critical at longer\\nsequence lengths, as memory constraints limit batching across examples. Recent work has achieved\\nsignificant improvements in computational efficiency through factorization tricks [ 21] and conditional\\ncomputation [ 32], while also improving model performance in case of the latter. The fundamental\\nconstraint of sequential computation, however, remains.\\nAttention mechanisms have become an integral part of compelling sequence modeling and transduc-\\ntion models in various tasks, allowing modeling of dependencies without regard to their distance in\\nthe input or output sequences [ 2,19]. In all but a few cases [ 27], however, such attention mechanisms\\nare used in conjunction with a recurrent network.\\nIn this work we propose the Transformer, a model architecture eschewing recurrence and instead\\nrelying entirely on an attention mechanism to draw global dependencies between input and output.\\nThe Transformer allows for significantly more parallelization and can reach a new state of the art in\\ntranslation quality after being trained for as little as twelve hours on eight P100 GPUs.\\n2 Background\\nThe goal of reducing sequential computation also forms the foundation of the Extended Neural GPU\\n[16], ByteNet [ 18] and ConvS2S [ 9], all of which use convolutional neural networks as basic building\\nblock, computing hidden representations in parallel for all input and output positions. In these models,\\nthe number of operations required to relate signals from two arbitrary input or output positions grows\\nin the distance between positions, linearly for ConvS2S and logarithmically for ByteNet. This makes\\nit more difficult to learn dependencies between distant positions [ 12]. In the Transformer this is\\nreduced to a constant number of operations, albeit at the cost of reduced effective resolution due\\nto averaging attention-weighted positions, an effect we counteract with Multi-Head Attention as\\ndescribed in section 3.2.\\nSelf-attention, sometimes called intra-attention is an attention mechanism relating different positions\\nof a single sequence in order to compute a representation of the sequence. Self-attention has been\\nused successfully in a variety of tasks including reading comprehension, abstractive summarization,\\ntextual entailment and learning task-independent sentence representations [4, 27, 28, 22].\\nEnd-to-end memory networks are based on a recurrent attention mechanism instead of sequence-\\naligned recurrence and have been shown to perform well on simple-language question answering and\\nlanguage modeling tasks [34].\\nTo the best of our knowledge, however, the Transformer is the first transduction model relying\\nentirely on self-attention to compute representations of its input and output without using sequence-\\naligned RNNs or convolution. In the following sections, we will describe the Transformer, motivate\\nself-attention and discuss its advantages over models such as [17, 18] and [9].\\n3 Model Architecture\\nMost competitive neural sequence transduction models have an encoder-decoder structure [ 5,2,35].\\nHere, the encoder maps an input sequence of symbol representations (x1, ..., x n)to a sequence'),\n",

Each layer has two\\nsub-layers. The first is a multi-head self-attention mechanism, and the second is a simple, position-\\nwise fully connected feed-forward network. We employ a residual connection [ 11] around each of\\nthe two sub-layers, followed by layer normalization [ 1]. That is, the output of each sub-layer is\\nLayerNorm( x+ Sublayer( x)), where Sublayer( x)is the function implemented by the sub-layer\\nitself. To facilitate these residual connections, all sub-layers in the model, as well as the embedding\\nlayers, produce outputs of dimension dmodel = 512 .\\nDecoder: The decoder is also composed of a stack of N= 6identical layers. In addition to the two\\nsub-layers in each encoder layer, the decoder inserts a third sub-layer, which performs multi-head\\nattention over the output of the encoder stack. Similar to the encoder, we employ residual connections\\naround each of the sub-layers, followed by layer normalization. We also modify the self-attention\\nsub-layer in the decoder stack to prevent positions from attending to subsequent positions. This\\nmasking, combined with fact that the output embeddings are offset by one position, ensures that the\\npredictions for position ican depend only on the known outputs at positions less than i.\\n3.2 Attention\\nAn attention function can be described as mapping a query and a set of key-value pairs to an output,\\nwhere the query, keys, values, and output are all vectors. The output is computed as a weighted sum\\n3'),\n",

The input consists of\\nqueries and keys of dimension dk, and values of dimension dv. We compute the dot products of the\\nquery with all keys, divide each by√dk, and apply a softmax function to obtain the weights on the\\nvalues.\\nIn practice, we compute the attention function on a set of queries simultaneously, packed together\\ninto a matrix Q. The keys and values are also packed together into matrices KandV. We compute\\nthe matrix of outputs as:\\nAttention( Q, K, V ) = softmax(QKT\\n√dk)V (1)\\nThe two most commonly used attention functions are additive attention [ 2], and dot-product (multi-\\nplicative) attention. Dot-product attention is identical to our algorithm, except for the scaling factor\\nof1√dk. Additive attention computes the compatibility function using a feed-forward network with\\na single hidden layer. While the two are similar in theoretical complexity, dot-product attention is\\nmuch faster and more space-efficient in practice, since it can be implemented using highly optimized\\nmatrix multiplication code.\\nWhile for small values of dkthe two mechanisms perform similarly, additive attention outperforms\\ndot product attention without scaling for larger values of dk[3]. We suspect that for large values of\\ndk, the dot products grow large in magnitude, pushing the softmax function into regions where it has\\nextremely small gradients4. To counteract this effect, we scale the dot products by1√dk.\\n3.2.2 Multi-Head Attention\\nInstead of performing a single attention function with dmodel-dimensional keys, values and queries,\\nwe found it beneficial to linearly project the queries, keys and values htimes with different, learned\\nlinear projections to dk,dkanddvdimensions, respectively. On each of these projected versions of\\nqueries, keys and values we then perform the attention function in parallel, yielding dv-dimensional\\n4To illustrate why the dot products get large, assume that the components of qandkare independent random\\nvariables with mean 0and variance 1.

For each of these we use\\ndk=dv=dmodel/h= 64 . Due to the reduced dimension of each head, the total computational cost\\nis similar to that of single-head attention with full dimensionality.\\n3.2.3 Applications of Attention in our Model\\nThe Transformer uses multi-head attention in three different ways:\\n•In \"encoder-decoder attention\" layers, the queries come from the previous decoder layer,\\nand the memory keys and values come from the output of the encoder. This allows every\\nposition in the decoder to attend over all positions in the input sequence. This mimics the\\ntypical encoder-decoder attention mechanisms in sequence-to-sequence models such as\\n[38, 2, 9].\\n•The encoder contains self-attention layers. In a self-attention layer all of the keys, values\\nand queries come from the same place, in this case, the output of the previous layer in the\\nencoder. Each position in the encoder can attend to all positions in the previous layer of the\\nencoder.\\n•Similarly, self-attention layers in the decoder allow each position in the decoder to attend to\\nall positions in the decoder up to and including that position. We need to prevent leftward\\ninformation flow in the decoder to preserve the auto-regressive property. We implement this\\ninside of scaled dot-product attention by masking out (setting to −∞) all values in the input\\nof the softmax which correspond to illegal connections. See Figure 2.\\n3.3 Position-wise Feed-Forward Networks\\nIn addition to attention sub-layers, each of the layers in our encoder and decoder contains a fully\\nconnected feed-forward network, which is applied to each position separately and identically. This\\nconsists of two linear transformations with a ReLU activation in between.\\nFFN( x) = max(0 , xW 1+b1)W2+b2 (2)\\nWhile the linear transformations are the same across different positions, they use different parameters\\nfrom layer to layer. Another way of describing this is as two convolutions with kernel size 1.\\nThe dimensionality of input and output is dmodel = 512 , and the inner-layer has dimensionality\\ndff= 2048 .\\n3.4 Embeddings and Softmax\\nSimilarly to other sequence transduction models, we use learned embeddings to convert the input\\ntokens and output tokens to vectors of dimension dmodel. We also use the usual learned linear transfor-\\nmation and softmax function to convert the decoder output to predicted next-token probabilities. In\\nour model, we share the same weight matrix between the two embedding layers and the pre-softmax\\nlinear transformation, similar to [ 30]. In the embedding layers, we multiply those weights by√dmodel.\\n5'),\n",

To this end, we add \"positional encodings\" to the input embeddings at the\\nbottoms of the encoder and decoder stacks. The positional encodings have the same dimension dmodel\\nas the embeddings, so that the two can be summed. There are many choices of positional encodings,\\nlearned and fixed [9].\\nIn this work, we use sine and cosine functions of different frequencies:\\nPE(pos,2i)=sin(pos/100002i/d model)\\nPE(pos,2i+1)=cos(pos/100002i/d model)\\nwhere posis the position and iis the dimension. That is, each dimension of the positional encoding\\ncorresponds to a sinusoid. The wavelengths form a geometric progression from 2πto10000 ·2π. We\\nchose this function because we hypothesized it would allow the model to easily learn to attend by\\nrelative positions, since for any fixed offset k,PEpos+kcan be represented as a linear function of\\nPEpos.\\nWe also experimented with using learned positional embeddings [ 9] instead, and found that the two\\nversions produced nearly identical results (see Table 3 row (E)). We chose the sinusoidal version\\nbecause it may allow the model to extrapolate to sequence lengths longer than the ones encountered\\nduring training.\\n4 Why Self-Attention\\nIn this section we compare various aspects of self-attention layers to the recurrent and convolu-\\ntional layers commonly used for mapping one variable-length sequence of symbol representations\\n(x1, ..., x n)to another sequence of equal length (z1, ..., z n), with xi, zi∈Rd, such as a hidden\\nlayer in a typical sequence transduction encoder or decoder. Motivating our use of self-attention we\\nconsider three desiderata.\\nOne is the total computational complexity per layer. Another is the amount of computation that can\\nbe parallelized, as measured by the minimum number of sequential operations required.\\nThe third is the path length between long-range dependencies in the network. Learning long-range\\ndependencies is a key challenge in many sequence transduction tasks. One key factor affecting the\\nability to learn such dependencies is the length of the paths forward and backward signals have to\\ntraverse in the network. The shorter these paths between any combination of positions in the input\\nand output sequences, the easier it is to learn long-range dependencies [ 12]. Hence we also compare\\nthe maximum path length between any two input and output positions in networks composed of the\\ndifferent layer types.\\nAs noted in Table 1, a self-attention layer connects all positions with a constant number of sequentially\\nexecuted operations, whereas a recurrent layer requires O(n)sequential operations. In terms of\\ncomputational complexity, self-attention layers are faster than recurrent layers when the sequence\\n6'),\n",

To improve computational performance for tasks involving\\nvery long sequences, self-attention could be restricted to considering only a neighborhood of size rin\\nthe input sequence centered around the respective output position. This would increase the maximum\\npath length to O(n/r). We plan to investigate this approach further in future work.\\nA single convolutional layer with kernel width k < n does not connect all pairs of input and output\\npositions. Doing so requires a stack of O(n/k)convolutional layers in the case of contiguous kernels,\\norO(logk(n))in the case of dilated convolutions [ 18], increasing the length of the longest paths\\nbetween any two positions in the network. Convolutional layers are generally more expensive than\\nrecurrent layers, by a factor of k. Separable convolutions [ 6], however, decrease the complexity\\nconsiderably, to O(k·n·d+n·d2). Even with k=n, however, the complexity of a separable\\nconvolution is equal to the combination of a self-attention layer and a point-wise feed-forward layer,\\nthe approach we take in our model.\\nAs side benefit, self-attention could yield more interpretable models. We inspect attention distributions\\nfrom our models and present and discuss examples in the appendix. Not only do individual attention\\nheads clearly learn to perform different tasks, many appear to exhibit behavior related to the syntactic\\nand semantic structure of the sentences.\\n5 Training\\nThis section describes the training regime for our models.\\n5.1 Training Data and Batching\\nWe trained on the standard WMT 2014 English-German dataset consisting of about 4.5 million\\nsentence pairs. Sentences were encoded using byte-pair encoding [ 3], which has a shared source-\\ntarget vocabulary of about 37000 tokens. For English-French, we used the significantly larger WMT\\n2014 English-French dataset consisting of 36M sentences and split tokens into a 32000 word-piece\\nvocabulary [ 38]. Sentence pairs were batched together by approximate sequence length. Each training\\nbatch contained a set of sentence pairs containing approximately 25000 source tokens and 25000\\ntarget tokens.\\n5.2 Hardware and Schedule\\nWe trained our models on one machine with 8 NVIDIA P100 GPUs.

We present these results in Table 3.\\nIn Table 3 rows (A), we vary the number of attention heads and the attention key and value dimensions,\\nkeeping the amount of computation constant, as described in Section 3.2.2. While single-head\\nattention is 0.9 BLEU worse than the best setting, quality also drops off with too many heads.\\nIn Table 3 rows (B), we observe that reducing the attention key size dkhurts model quality. This\\nsuggests that determining compatibility is not easy and that a more sophisticated compatibility\\nfunction than dot product may be beneficial. We further observe in rows (C) and (D) that, as expected,\\nbigger models are better, and dropout is very helpful in avoiding over-fitting. In row (E) we replace our\\nsinusoidal positional encoding with learned positional embeddings [ 9], and observe nearly identical\\nresults to the base model.\\n6.3 English Constituency Parsing\\nTo evaluate if the Transformer can generalize to other tasks we performed experiments on English\\nconstituency parsing. This task presents specific challenges: the output is subject to strong structural\\nconstraints and is significantly longer than the input. Furthermore, RNN sequence-to-sequence\\nmodels have not been able to attain state-of-the-art results in small-data regimes [37].\\nWe trained a 4-layer transformer with dmodel = 1024 on the Wall Street Journal (WSJ) portion of the\\nPenn Treebank [ 25], about 40K training sentences. We also trained it in a semi-supervised setting,\\nusing the larger high-confidence and BerkleyParser corpora from with approximately 17M sentences\\n[37]. We used a vocabulary of 16K tokens for the WSJ only setting and a vocabulary of 32K tokens\\nfor the semi-supervised setting.\\nWe performed only a small number of experiments to select the dropout, both attention and residual\\n(section 5.4), learning rates and beam size on the Section 22 development set, all other parameters\\nremained unchanged from the English-to-German base translation model.

On both WMT 2014 English-to-German and WMT 2014\\nEnglish-to-French translation tasks, we achieve a new state of the art. In the former task our best\\nmodel outperforms even all previously reported ensembles.\\nWe are excited about the future of attention-based models and plan to apply them to other tasks. We\\nplan to extend the Transformer to problems involving input and output modalities other than text and\\nto investigate local, restricted attention mechanisms to efficiently handle large inputs and outputs\\nsuch as images, audio and video. Making generation less sequential is another research goals of ours.\\nThe code we used to train and evaluate our models is available at https://github.com/\\ntensorflow/tensor2tensor .\\nAcknowledgements We are grateful to Nal Kalchbrenner and Stephan Gouws for their fruitful\\ncomments, corrections and inspiration.\\nReferences\\n[1]Jimmy Lei Ba, Jamie Ryan Kiros, and Geoffrey E Hinton.

       "  Document(metadata={'page': 1, 'source': './paper.pdf'}, page_content='1 Introduction\\nRecurrent neural networks, long short-term memory [ 13] and gated recurrent [ 7] neural networks\\nin particular, have been firmly established as state of the art approaches in sequence modeling and\\ntransduction problems such as language modeling and machine translation [ 35,2,5]. Numerous\\nefforts have since continued to push the boundaries of recurrent language models and encoder-decoder\\narchitectures [38, 24, 15].\\nRecurrent models typically factor computation along the symbol positions of the input and output\\nsequences. Aligning the positions to steps in computation time, they generate a sequence of hidden\\nstates ht, as a function of the previous hidden state ht−1and the input for position t. This inherently\\nsequential nature precludes parallelization within training examples, which becomes critical at longer\\nsequence lengths, as memory constraints limit batching across examples. Recent work has achieved\\nsignificant improvements in computational efficiency through factorization tricks [ 21] and conditional\\ncomputation [ 32], while also improving model performance in case of the latter. The fundamental\\nconstraint of sequential computation, however, remains.\\nAttention mechanisms have become an integral part of compelling sequence modeling and transduc-\\ntion models in various tasks, allowing modeling of dependencies without regard to their distance in\\nthe input or output sequences [ 2,19]. In all but a few cases [ 27], however, such attention mechanisms\\nare used in conjunction with a recurrent network.\\nIn this work we propose the Transformer, a model architecture eschewing recurrence and instead\\nrelying entirely on an attention mechanism to draw global dependencies between input and output.\\nThe Transformer allows for significantly more parallelization and can reach a new state of the art in\\ntranslation quality after being trained for as little as twelve hours on eight P100 GPUs.\\n2 Background\\nThe goal of reducing sequential computation also forms the foundation of the Extended Neural GPU\\n[16], ByteNet [ 18] and ConvS2S [ 9], all of which use convolutional neural networks as basic building\\nblock, computing hidden representations in parallel for all input and output positions. In these models,\\nthe number of operations required to relate signals from two arbitrary input or output positions grows\\nin the distance between positions, linearly for ConvS2S and logarithmically for ByteNet. This makes\\nit more difficult to learn dependencies between distant positions [ 12]. In the Transformer this is\\nreduced to a constant number of operations, albeit at the cost of reduced effective resolution due\\nto averaging attention-weighted positions, an effect we counteract with Multi-Head Attention as\\ndescribed in section 3.2.\\nSelf-attention, sometimes called intra-attention is an attention mechanism relating different positions\\nof a single sequence in order to compute a representation of the sequence. Self-attention has been\\nused successfully in a variety of tasks including reading comprehension, abstractive summarization,\\ntextual entailment and learning task-independent sentence representations [4, 27, 28, 22].\\nEnd-to-end memory networks are based on a recurrent attention mechanism instead of sequence-\\naligned recurrence and have been shown to perform well on simple-language question answering and\\nlanguage modeling tasks [34].\\nTo the best of our knowledge, however, the Transformer is the first transduction model relying\\nentirely on self-attention to compute representations of its input and output without using sequence-\\naligned RNNs or convolution. In the following sections, we will describe the Transformer, motivate\\nself-attention and discuss its advantages over models such as [17, 18] and [9].\\n3 Model Architecture\\nMost competitive neural sequence transduction models have an encoder-decoder structure [ 5,2,35].\\nHere, the encoder maps an input sequence of symbol representations (x1, ..., x n)to a sequence')],\n",
       " 'answer': 'Self-attention, sometimes referred to as intra-attention, is an attention mechanism that relates different positions of a single sequence in order to compute a representation of that sequence. It allows the model to weigh the importance of different words or tokens in the input sequence relative to each other, regardless of their distance in the sequence. This mechanism enables the model to capture dependencies and relationships between words effectively, which is particularly useful in tasks such as reading comprehension, summarization, and language modeling.\\n\\nIn self-attention, each word in the input sequence is transformed into a query, key, and value representation. The attention scores are computed by taking the dot product of the query with all keys, followed by a softmax operation to obtain a distribution of attention weights. These weights are then used to compute a weighted sum of the value representations, resulting in a new representation for each word that incorporates information from the entire sequence.\\n\\nSelf-attention is a key component of the Transformer architecture, which relies entirely on this mechanism to process input and output sequences without using recurrent or convolutional layers.

The best\\nperforming models also connect the encoder and decoder through an attention\\nmechanism. We propose a new simple network architecture, the Transformer,\\nbased solely on attention mechanisms, dispensing with recurrence and convolutions\\nentirely. Experiments on two machine translation tasks show these models to\\nbe superior in quality while being more parallelizable and requiring significantly\\nless time to train. Our model achieves 28.4 BLEU on the WMT 2014 English-\\nto-German translation task, improving over the existing best results, including\\nensembles, by over 2 BLEU. On the WMT 2014 English-to-French translation task,\\nour model establishes a new single-model state-of-the-art BLEU score of 41.8 after\\ntraining for 3.5 days on eight GPUs, a small fraction of the training costs of the\\nbest models from the literature. We show that the Transformer generalizes well to\\nother tasks by applying it successfully to English constituency parsing both with\\nlarge and limited training data.\\n∗Equal contribution. Listing order is random. Jakob proposed replacing RNNs with self-attention and started\\nthe effort to evaluate this idea. Ashish, with Illia, designed and implemented the first Transformer models and\\nhas been crucially involved in every aspect of this work. Noam proposed scaled dot-product attention, multi-head\\nattention and the parameter-free position representation and became the other person involved in nearly every\\ndetail. Niki designed, implemented, tuned and evaluated countless model variants in our original codebase and\\ntensor2tensor. Llion also experimented with novel model variants, was responsible for our initial codebase, and\\nefficient inference and visualizations. Lukasz and Aidan spent countless long days designing various parts of and\\nimplementing tensor2tensor, replacing our earlier codebase, greatly improving results and massively accelerating\\nour research.\\n†Work performed while at Google Brain.\\n‡Work performed while at Google Research.\\n31st Conference on Neural Information Processing Systems (NIPS 2017), Long Beach, CA, USA.arXiv:1706.03762v7  [cs.CL]  2 Aug 2023'),\n",

Instead langchain-community will now depend on langchain-core and langchain .User code that still relies on deprecated imports from langchain will continue to work as long langchain_community is installed. These imports will start raising errors in release 0.4.x.As of 0.1.0:langchain was split into the following component packages: langchain-core, langchain, langchain-community, langchain-[partner] to improve the usability of langchain code in production settings. You can read more about it on our blog.Ecosystem organization\\u200bBy the release of 0.1.0, LangChain had grown to a large ecosystem with many integrations and a large community.To improve the usability of LangChain in production, we split the single langchain package into multiple packages. This allowed us to create a good foundation architecture for the LangChain ecosystem and improve the usability of langchain in production.Here is the high level break down of the Eco-system:langchain-core:  contains core abstractions involving LangChain Runnables, tooling for observability, and base implementations of important abstractions (e.g., Chat Models).langchain: contains generic code that is built using interfaces defined in langchain-core. This package is for code that generalizes well across different implementations of specific interfaces. For example, create_tool_calling_agent works across chat models that support tool calling capabilities.langchain-community: community maintained 3rd party integrations. Contains integrations based on interfaces defined in langchain-core. Maintained by the LangChain community.Partner Packages (e.g., langchain-[partner]): Partner packages are packages dedicated to especially popular integrations (e.g., langchain-openai, langchain-anthropic etc.). The dedicated packages generally benefit from better reliability and support.langgraph: Build robust and stateful multi-actor applications with LLMs by modeling steps as edges and nodes in a graph.langserve: Deploy LangChain chains as REST APIs.In the 0.1.0 release, langchain-community was retained as required a dependency of langchain.This allowed imports of vectorstores, chat models, and other integrations to continue working through langchain'),\n",

This is something we’ve been planning to do since the 0.1 release because we believe this is the right package architecture.Old imports will continue to work as long as langchain-community is installed. These imports will be removed in the 0.4.0 release.To understand why we think breaking the dependency of langchain on langchain-community is best we should understand what each package is meant to do.langchain is meant to contain high-level chains and agent architectures. The logic in these should be specified at the level of abstractions like ChatModel and Retriever, and should not be specific to any one integration. This has two main benefits:langchain is fairly lightweight. Here is the full list of required dependencies (after the split)python = \">=3.8.1,<4.0\"langchain-core = \"^0.2.0\"langchain-text-splitters = \">=0.0.1,<0.1\"langsmith = \"^0.1.17\"pydantic = \">=1,<3\"SQLAlchemy = \">=1.4,<3\"requests = \"^2\"PyYAML = \">=5.3\"numpy = \"^1\"aiohttp = \"^3.8.3\"tenacity = \"^8.1.0\"jsonpatch = \"^1.33\"langchain chains/agents are largely integration-agnostic, which makes it easy to experiment with different integrations and future-proofs your code should there be issues with one specific integration.There is also a third less tangible benefit which is that being integration-agnostic forces us to find only those very generic abstractions and architectures which generalize well across integrations. Given how general the abilities of the foundational tech are, and how quickly the space is moving, having generic architectures is a good way of future-proofing your applications.langchain-community is intended to have all integration-specific components that are not yet being maintained in separate langchain-{partner} packages. Today this is still the majority of integrations and a lot of code. This code is primarily contributed by the community, while langchain is largely written by core maintainers. All of these integrations use optional dependencies and conditional imports, which prevents dependency bloat and conflicts but means compatible dependency versions are not made explicit. Given the volume of integrations in langchain-community and the speed at which integrations change, it’s very hard to follow semver versioning, and we currently don’t.All of which is to say that there’s no large benefits to langchain depending on langchain-community and some obvious downsides: the functionality in langchain should be integration agnostic anyways, langchain-community can’t be properly versioned, and depending on langchain-community increases the vulnerability surface of langchain.For more context about the reason for the organization please see our blog: https://blog.langchain.dev/langchain-v0-1-0/Edit this pageWas this page helpful?You can also leave detailed feedback on GitHub.PreviousConceptual guideNextRelease policyWhat’s new in LangChain?What’s coming to LangChain?What changed?TLDREcosystem organizationCommunityTwitterGitHubOrganizationPythonJS/TSMoreHomepageBlogYouTubeCopyright © 2024 LangChain, Inc.')]"

One common use-case is extracting data from text to insert into a database or use with some other downstream system. This guide covers a few strategies for getting structured outputs from a model.The .with_structured_output() method\\u200bSupported modelsYou can find a list of models that support this method here.This is the easiest and most reliable way to get structured outputs. with_structured_output() is implemented for models that provide native APIs for structuring outputs, like tool/function calling or JSON mode, and makes use of these capabilities under the hood.This method takes a schema as input which specifies the names, types, and descriptions of the desired output attributes. The method returns a model-like Runnable, except that instead of outputting strings or Messages it outputs objects'),\n",

The method returns a model-like Runnable, except that instead of outputting strings or Messages it outputs objects corresponding to the given schema. The schema can be specified as a TypedDict class, JSON Schema or a Pydantic class. If TypedDict or JSON Schema are used then a dictionary will be returned by the Runnable, and if a Pydantic class is used then a Pydantic object will be returned.As an example, let\\'s get a model to generate a joke and separate the setup from the punchline:OpenAIAnthropicAzureGoogleCohereNVIDIAFireworksAIGroqMistralAITogetherAIpip install -qU langchain-openaiimport getpassimport osos.environ[\"OPENAI_API_KEY\"] = getpass.getpass()from langchain_openai import ChatOpenAIllm = ChatOpenAI(model=\"gpt-4o-mini\")pip install -qU langchain-anthropicimport getpassimport osos.environ[\"ANTHROPIC_API_KEY\"] = getpass.getpass()from langchain_anthropic import ChatAnthropicllm = ChatAnthropic(model=\"claude-3-5-sonnet-20240620\")pip install -qU langchain-openaiimport getpassimport osos.environ[\"AZURE_OPENAI_API_KEY\"] = getpass.getpass()from langchain_openai import AzureChatOpenAIllm = AzureChatOpenAI(    azure_endpoint=os.environ[\"AZURE_OPENAI_ENDPOINT\"],    azure_deployment=os.environ[\"AZURE_OPENAI_DEPLOYMENT_NAME\"],    openai_api_version=os.environ[\"AZURE_OPENAI_API_VERSION\"],)pip install -qU langchain-google-vertexaiimport getpassimport osos.environ[\"GOOGLE_API_KEY\"] = getpass.getpass()from langchain_google_vertexai import ChatVertexAIllm = ChatVertexAI(model=\"gemini-1.5-flash\")pip install -qU langchain-cohereimport getpassimport osos.environ[\"COHERE_API_KEY\"] = getpass.getpass()from langchain_cohere import ChatCoherellm = ChatCohere(model=\"command-r-plus\")pip install -qU langchain-nvidia-ai-endpointsimport getpassimport osos.environ[\"NVIDIA_API_KEY\"] = getpass.getpass()from langchain import ChatNVIDIAllm = ChatNVIDIA(model=\"meta/llama3-70b-instruct\")pip install -qU langchain-fireworksimport getpassimport osos.environ[\"FIREWORKS_API_KEY\"] = getpass.getpass()from langchain_fireworks import ChatFireworksllm = ChatFireworks(model=\"accounts/fireworks/models/llama-v3p1-70b-instruct\")pip install -qU langchain-groqimport getpassimport osos.environ[\"GROQ_API_KEY\"] = getpass.getpass()from langchain_groq import ChatGroqllm = ChatGroq(model=\"llama3-8b-8192\")pip install -qU langchain-mistralaiimport getpassimport osos.environ[\"MISTRAL_API_KEY\"] = getpass.getpass()from langchain_mistralai import ChatMistralAIllm = ChatMistralAI(model=\"mistral-large-latest\")pip install -qU langchain-openaiimport getpassimport osos.environ[\"TOGETHER_API_KEY\"] = getpass.getpass()from langchain_openai import ChatOpenAIllm = ChatOpenAI(    base_url=\"https://api.together.xyz/v1\",    api_key=os.environ[\"TOGETHER_API_KEY\"],    model=\"mistralai/Mixtral-8x7B-Instruct-v0.1\",)Pydantic class\\u200bIf we want the model to return a Pydantic object, we just need to pass in the desired Pydantic class. The key advantage of using Pydantic is that the model-generated output will be validated. Pydantic will raise an error if any required fields are missing or if any fields are of the wrong type.from typing import Optionalfrom langchain_core.pydantic_v1 import BaseModel, Field# Pydanticclass Joke(BaseModel):    \"\"\"Joke to tell user.\"\"\"    setup: str = Field(description=\"The setup of the joke\")    punchline: str = Field(description=\"The punchline to the joke\")    rating: Optional[int] = Field(        default=None, description=\"How funny the joke is, from 1 to 10\"    )structured_llm = llm.with_structured_output(Joke)structured_llm.invoke(\"Tell me a joke about cats\")Joke(setup=\\'Why was the cat sitting on the computer?\\', punchline=\\'Because it wanted to keep an eye on the mouse!\\', rating=7)tipBeyond just the structure of the Pydantic class, the name of the Pydantic class, the docstring, and the names and provided descriptions of parameters are very important.

Most of the time with_structured_output is using a model\\'s function/tool calling API, and you can effectively think of all of this information as being added to the model prompt.TypedDict or JSON Schema\\u200bIf you don\\'t want to use Pydantic, explicitly don\\'t want validation of the arguments, or want to be able to stream the model outputs, you can define your schema using a TypedDict class. We can optionally use a special Annotated syntax supported by LangChain that allows you to specify the default value and description of a field. Note, the default value is not filled in automatically if the model doesn\\'t generate it, it is only used in defining the schema that is passed to the model.RequirementsCore: langchain-core>=0.2.26Typing extensions: It is highly recommended to import Annotated and TypedDict from typing_extensions instead of typing to ensure consistent behavior across Python versions.from typing_extensions import Annotated, TypedDict# TypedDictclass Joke(TypedDict):    \"\"\"Joke to tell user.\"\"\"    setup: Annotated[str, ..., \"The setup of the joke\"]    # Alternatively, we could have specified setup as:    # setup: str                    # no default, no description    # setup: Annotated[str, ...]    # no default, no description    # setup: Annotated[str, \"foo\"]  # default, no description    punchline: Annotated[str, ..., \"The punchline of the joke\"]    rating: Annotated[Optional[int], None, \"How funny the joke is, from 1 to 10\"]structured_llm = llm.with_structured_output(Joke)structured_llm.invoke(\"Tell me a joke about cats\"){\\'setup\\': \\'Why was the cat sitting on the computer?\\', \\'punchline\\': \\'Because it wanted to keep an eye on the mouse!\\', \\'rating\\': 7}Equivalently, we can pass in a JSON Schema dict. This requires no imports or classes and makes it very clear exactly how each parameter is documented, at the cost of being a bit more verbose.json_schema = {    \"title\": \"joke\",    \"description\": \"Joke to tell user.\",    \"type\": \"object\",    \"properties\": {        \"setup\": {            \"type\": \"string\",            \"description\": \"The setup of the joke\",        },        \"punchline\": {            \"type\": \"string\",            \"description\": \"The punchline to the joke\",        },        \"rating\": {            \"type\": \"integer\",            \"description\": \"How funny the joke is, from 1 to 10\",            \"default\": None,        },    },    \"required\": [\"setup\", \"punchline\"],}structured_llm = llm.with_structured_output(json_schema)structured_llm.invoke(\"Tell me a joke about cats\"){\\'setup\\': \\'Why was the cat sitting on the computer?\\', \\'punchline\\': \\'Because it wanted to keep an eye on the mouse!\\', \\'rating\\': 7}Choosing between multiple schemas\\u200bThe simplest way to let the model choose from multiple schemas is to create a parent schema that has a Union-typed attribute:from typing import Union# Pydanticclass Joke(BaseModel):    \"\"\"Joke to tell user.\"\"\"    setup: str = Field(description=\"The setup of the joke\")    punchline: str = Field(description=\"The punchline to the joke\")    rating: Optional[int] = Field(        default=None, description=\"How funny the joke is, from 1 to 10\"    )class ConversationalResponse(BaseModel):    \"\"\"Respond in a conversational manner.

How can I assist you today?\"))Alternatively, you can use tool calling directly to allow the model to choose between options, if your chosen model supports it. This involves a bit more parsing and setup but in some instances leads to better performance because you don\\'t have to use nested schemas. See this how-to guide for more details.Streaming\\u200bWe can stream outputs from our structured model when the output type is a dict (i.e., when the schema is specified as a TypedDict class or  JSON Schema dict). infoNote that what\\'s yielded is already aggregated chunks, not deltas.from typing_extensions import Annotated, TypedDict# TypedDictclass Joke(TypedDict):    \"\"\"Joke to tell user.\"\"\"    setup: Annotated[str, ..., \"The setup of the joke\"]    punchline: Annotated[str, ..., \"The punchline of the joke\"]    rating: Annotated[Optional[int], None, \"How funny the joke is, from 1 to 10\"]structured_llm = llm.with_structured_output(Joke)for chunk in structured_llm.stream(\"Tell me a joke about cats\"):    print(chunk){}{\\'setup\\': \\'\\'}{\\'setup\\': \\'Why\\'}{\\'setup\\': \\'Why was\\'}{\\'setup\\': \\'Why was the\\'}{\\'setup\\': \\'Why was the cat\\'}{\\'setup\\': \\'Why was the cat sitting\\'}{\\'setup\\': \\'Why was the cat sitting on\\'}{\\'setup\\': \\'Why was the cat sitting on the\\'}{\\'setup\\': \\'Why was the cat sitting on the computer\\'}{\\'setup\\': \\'Why was the cat sitting on the computer?\\'}{\\'setup\\': \\'Why was the cat sitting on the computer?\\', \\'punchline\\': \\'\\'}{\\'setup\\': \\'Why was the cat sitting on the computer?\\', \\'punchline\\': \\'Because\\'}{\\'setup\\': \\'Why was the cat sitting on the computer?\\', \\'punchline\\': \\'Because it\\'}{\\'setup\\': \\'Why was the cat sitting on the computer?\\', \\'punchline\\': \\'Because it wanted\\'}{\\'setup\\': \\'Why was the cat sitting on the computer?\\', \\'punchline\\': \\'Because it wanted to\\'}{\\'setup\\': \\'Why was the cat sitting on the computer?\\', \\'punchline\\': \\'Because it wanted to keep\\'}{\\'setup\\': \\'Why was the cat sitting on the computer?\\', \\'punchline\\': \\'Because it wanted to keep an\\'}{\\'setup\\': \\'Why was the cat sitting on the computer?\\', \\'punchline\\': \\'Because it wanted to keep an eye\\'}{\\'setup\\': \\'Why was the cat sitting on the computer?\\', \\'punchline\\': \\'Because it wanted to keep an eye on\\'}{\\'setup\\': \\'Why was the cat sitting on the computer?\\', \\'punchline\\': \\'Because it wanted to keep an eye on the\\'}{\\'setup\\': \\'Why was the cat sitting on the computer?\\', \\'punchline\\': \\'Because it wanted to keep an eye on the mouse\\'}{\\'setup\\': \\'Why was the cat sitting on the computer?\\', \\'punchline\\': \\'Because it wanted to keep an eye on the mouse!\\'}{\\'setup\\': \\'Why was the cat sitting on the computer?\\', \\'punchline\\': \\'Because it wanted to keep an eye on the mouse!\\', \\'rating\\': 7}Few-shot prompting\\u200bFor more complex schemas it\\'s very useful to add few-shot examples to the prompt. This can be done in a few ways.The simplest and most universal way is to add examples to a system message in the prompt:from langchain_core.prompts import ChatPromptTemplatesystem = \"\"\"You are a hilarious comedian. Your specialty is knock-knock jokes. \\\\Return a joke which has the setup (the response to \"Who\\'s there?\") and the final punchline (the response to \"<setup> who?\").Here are some examples of jokes:example_user: Tell me a joke about planesexample_assistant: {{\"setup\": \"Why don\\'t planes ever get tired?\", \"punchline\": \"Because they have rest wings!\", \"rating\": 2}}example_user: Tell me another joke about planesexample_assistant: {{\"setup\": \"Cargo\", \"punchline\": \"Cargo \\'vroom vroom\\', but planes go \\'zoom zoom\\'!\", \"rating\": 10}}example_user: Now about caterpillarsexample_assistant: {{\"setup\": \"Caterpillar\", \"punchline\": \"Caterpillar really slow, but watch me turn into a butterfly and steal the show!\", \"rating\": 5}}\"\"\"prompt = ChatPromptTemplate.from_messages([(\"system\", system), (\"human\", \"{input}\")])few_shot_structured_llm = prompt | structured_llmfew_shot_structured_llm.invoke(\"what\\'s something funny about'),\n",

For such models you\\'ll need to directly prompt the model to use a specific format, and use an output parser to extract the structured response from the raw model output.Using PydanticOutputParser\\u200bThe following example uses the built-in PydanticOutputParser to parse the output of a chat model prompted to match the given Pydantic schema. Note that we are adding format_instructions directly to the prompt from a method on the parser:from typing import Listfrom langchain_core.output_parsers import PydanticOutputParserfrom langchain_core.prompts import ChatPromptTemplatefrom langchain_core.pydantic_v1 import BaseModel, Fieldclass Person(BaseModel):    \"\"\"Information about a person.\"\"\"    name: str = Field(..., description=\"The name of the person\")    height_in_meters: float = Field(        ..., description=\"The height of the person expressed in meters.\"    )class People(BaseModel):    \"\"\"Identifying information about all people in a text.\"\"\"    people: List[Person]# Set up a parserparser = PydanticOutputParser(pydantic_object=People)# Promptprompt = ChatPromptTemplate.from_messages(    [        (            \"system\",            \"Answer the user query.

Wrap the output in `json` tagsThe output should be formatted as a JSON instance that conforms to the JSON schema below.As an example, for the schema {\"properties\": {\"foo\": {\"title\": \"Foo\", \"description\": \"a list of strings\", \"type\": \"array\", \"items\": {\"type\": \"string\"}}}, \"required\": [\"foo\"]}the object {\"foo\": [\"bar\", \"baz\"]} is a well-formatted instance of the schema. The object {\"properties\": {\"foo\": [\"bar\", \"baz\"]}} is not well-formatted.Here is the output schema:{\"description\": \"Identifying information about all people in a text.\", \"properties\": {\"people\": {\"title\": \"People\", \"type\": \"array\", \"items\": {\"$ref\": \"#/definitions/Person\"}}}, \"required\": [\"people\"], \"definitions\": {\"Person\": {\"title\": \"Person\",'),\n",

Instead langchain-community will now depend on langchain-core and langchain .User code that still relies on deprecated imports from langchain will continue to work as long langchain_community is installed. These imports will start raising errors in release 0.4.x.As of 0.1.0:langchain was split into the following component packages: langchain-core, langchain, langchain-community, langchain-[partner] to improve the usability of langchain code in production settings. You can read more about it on our blog.Ecosystem organization\\u200bBy the release of 0.1.0, LangChain had grown to a large ecosystem with many integrations and a large community.To improve the usability of LangChain in production, we split the single langchain package into multiple packages. This allowed us to create a good foundation architecture for the LangChain ecosystem and improve the usability of langchain in production.Here is the high level break down of the Eco-system:langchain-core:  contains core abstractions involving LangChain Runnables, tooling for observability, and base implementations of important abstractions (e.g., Chat Models).langchain: contains generic code that is built using interfaces defined in langchain-core. This package is for code that generalizes well across different implementations of specific interfaces. For example, create_tool_calling_agent works across chat models that support tool calling capabilities.langchain-community: community maintained 3rd party integrations. Contains integrations based on interfaces defined in langchain-core. Maintained by the LangChain community.Partner Packages (e.g., langchain-[partner]): Partner packages are packages dedicated to especially popular integrations (e.g., langchain-openai, langchain-anthropic etc.). The dedicated packages generally benefit from better reliability and support.langgraph: Build robust and stateful multi-actor applications with LLMs by modeling steps as edges and nodes in a graph.langserve: Deploy LangChain chains as REST APIs.In the 0.1.0 release, langchain-community was retained as required a dependency of langchain.This allowed imports of vectorstores, chat models, and other integrations to continue working through langchain'),\n",

This is something we’ve been planning to do since the 0.1 release because we believe this is the right package architecture.Old imports will continue to work as long as langchain-community is installed. These imports will be removed in the 0.4.0 release.To understand why we think breaking the dependency of langchain on langchain-community is best we should understand what each package is meant to do.langchain is meant to contain high-level chains and agent architectures. The logic in these should be specified at the level of abstractions like ChatModel and Retriever, and should not be specific to any one integration. This has two main benefits:langchain is fairly lightweight. Here is the full list of required dependencies (after the split)python = \">=3.8.1,<4.0\"langchain-core = \"^0.2.0\"langchain-text-splitters = \">=0.0.1,<0.1\"langsmith = \"^0.1.17\"pydantic = \">=1,<3\"SQLAlchemy = \">=1.4,<3\"requests = \"^2\"PyYAML = \">=5.3\"numpy = \"^1\"aiohttp = \"^3.8.3\"tenacity = \"^8.1.0\"jsonpatch = \"^1.33\"langchain chains/agents are largely integration-agnostic, which makes it easy to experiment with different integrations and future-proofs your code should there be issues with one specific integration.There is also a third less tangible benefit which is that being integration-agnostic forces us to find only those very generic abstractions and architectures which generalize well across integrations. Given how general the abilities of the foundational tech are, and how quickly the space is moving, having generic architectures is a good way of future-proofing your applications.langchain-community is intended to have all integration-specific components that are not yet being maintained in separate langchain-{partner} packages. Today this is still the majority of integrations and a lot of code. This code is primarily contributed by the community, while langchain is largely written by core maintainers. All of these integrations use optional dependencies and conditional imports, which prevents dependency bloat and conflicts but means compatible dependency versions are not made explicit. Given the volume of integrations in langchain-community and the speed at which integrations change, it’s very hard to follow semver versioning, and we currently don’t.All of which is to say that there’s no large benefits to langchain depending on langchain-community and some obvious downsides: the functionality in langchain should be integration agnostic anyways, langchain-community can’t be properly versioned, and depending on langchain-community increases the vulnerability surface of langchain.For more context about the reason for the organization please see our blog: https://blog.langchain.dev/langchain-v0-1-0/Edit this pageWas this page helpful?You can also leave detailed feedback on GitHub.PreviousConceptual guideNextRelease policyWhat’s new in LangChain?What’s coming to LangChain?What changed?TLDREcosystem organizationCommunityTwitterGitHubOrganizationPythonJS/TSMoreHomepageBlogYouTubeCopyright © 2024 LangChain, Inc.'),\n",

One common use-case is extracting data from text to insert into a database or use with some other downstream system. This guide covers a few strategies for getting structured outputs from a model.The .with_structured_output() method\\u200bSupported modelsYou can find a list of models that support this method here.This is the easiest and most reliable way to get structured outputs. with_structured_output() is implemented for models that provide native APIs for structuring outputs, like tool/function calling or JSON mode, and makes use of these capabilities under the hood.This method takes a schema as input which specifies the names, types, and descriptions of the desired output attributes. The method returns a model-like Runnable, except that instead of outputting strings or Messages it outputs objects'),\n",

The method returns a model-like Runnable, except that instead of outputting strings or Messages it outputs objects corresponding to the given schema. The schema can be specified as a TypedDict class, JSON Schema or a Pydantic class. If TypedDict or JSON Schema are used then a dictionary will be returned by the Runnable, and if a Pydantic class is used then a Pydantic object will be returned.As an example, let\\'s get a model to generate a joke and separate the setup from the punchline:OpenAIAnthropicAzureGoogleCohereNVIDIAFireworksAIGroqMistralAITogetherAIpip install -qU langchain-openaiimport getpassimport osos.environ[\"OPENAI_API_KEY\"] = getpass.getpass()from langchain_openai import ChatOpenAIllm = ChatOpenAI(model=\"gpt-4o-mini\")pip install -qU langchain-anthropicimport getpassimport osos.environ[\"ANTHROPIC_API_KEY\"] = getpass.getpass()from langchain_anthropic import ChatAnthropicllm = ChatAnthropic(model=\"claude-3-5-sonnet-20240620\")pip install -qU langchain-openaiimport getpassimport osos.environ[\"AZURE_OPENAI_API_KEY\"] = getpass.getpass()from langchain_openai import AzureChatOpenAIllm = AzureChatOpenAI(    azure_endpoint=os.environ[\"AZURE_OPENAI_ENDPOINT\"],    azure_deployment=os.environ[\"AZURE_OPENAI_DEPLOYMENT_NAME\"],    openai_api_version=os.environ[\"AZURE_OPENAI_API_VERSION\"],)pip install -qU langchain-google-vertexaiimport getpassimport osos.environ[\"GOOGLE_API_KEY\"] = getpass.getpass()from langchain_google_vertexai import ChatVertexAIllm = ChatVertexAI(model=\"gemini-1.5-flash\")pip install -qU langchain-cohereimport getpassimport osos.environ[\"COHERE_API_KEY\"] = getpass.getpass()from langchain_cohere import ChatCoherellm = ChatCohere(model=\"command-r-plus\")pip install -qU langchain-nvidia-ai-endpointsimport getpassimport osos.environ[\"NVIDIA_API_KEY\"] = getpass.getpass()from langchain import ChatNVIDIAllm = ChatNVIDIA(model=\"meta/llama3-70b-instruct\")pip install -qU langchain-fireworksimport getpassimport osos.environ[\"FIREWORKS_API_KEY\"] = getpass.getpass()from langchain_fireworks import ChatFireworksllm = ChatFireworks(model=\"accounts/fireworks/models/llama-v3p1-70b-instruct\")pip install -qU langchain-groqimport getpassimport osos.environ[\"GROQ_API_KEY\"] = getpass.getpass()from langchain_groq import ChatGroqllm = ChatGroq(model=\"llama3-8b-8192\")pip install -qU langchain-mistralaiimport getpassimport osos.environ[\"MISTRAL_API_KEY\"] = getpass.getpass()from langchain_mistralai import ChatMistralAIllm = ChatMistralAI(model=\"mistral-large-latest\")pip install -qU langchain-openaiimport getpassimport osos.environ[\"TOGETHER_API_KEY\"] = getpass.getpass()from langchain_openai import ChatOpenAIllm = ChatOpenAI(    base_url=\"https://api.together.xyz/v1\",    api_key=os.environ[\"TOGETHER_API_KEY\"],    model=\"mistralai/Mixtral-8x7B-Instruct-v0.1\",)Pydantic class\\u200bIf we want the model to return a Pydantic object, we just need to pass in the desired Pydantic class. The key advantage of using Pydantic is that the model-generated output will be validated. Pydantic will raise an error if any required fields are missing or if any fields are of the wrong type.from typing import Optionalfrom langchain_core.pydantic_v1 import BaseModel, Field# Pydanticclass Joke(BaseModel):    \"\"\"Joke to tell user.\"\"\"    setup: str = Field(description=\"The setup of the joke\")    punchline: str = Field(description=\"The punchline to the joke\")    rating: Optional[int] = Field(        default=None, description=\"How funny the joke is, from 1 to 10\"    )structured_llm = llm.with_structured_output(Joke)structured_llm.invoke(\"Tell me a joke about cats\")Joke(setup=\\'Why was the cat sitting on the computer?\\', punchline=\\'Because it wanted to keep an eye on the mouse!\\', rating=7)tipBeyond just the structure of the Pydantic class, the name of the Pydantic class, the docstring, and the names and provided descriptions of parameters are very important.

Most of the time with_structured_output is using a model\\'s function/tool calling API, and you can effectively think of all of this information as being added to the model prompt.TypedDict or JSON Schema\\u200bIf you don\\'t want to use Pydantic, explicitly don\\'t want validation of the arguments, or want to be able to stream the model outputs, you can define your schema using a TypedDict class. We can optionally use a special Annotated syntax supported by LangChain that allows you to specify the default value and description of a field. Note, the default value is not filled in automatically if the model doesn\\'t generate it, it is only used in defining the schema that is passed to the model.RequirementsCore: langchain-core>=0.2.26Typing extensions: It is highly recommended to import Annotated and TypedDict from typing_extensions instead of typing to ensure consistent behavior across Python versions.from typing_extensions import Annotated, TypedDict# TypedDictclass Joke(TypedDict):    \"\"\"Joke to tell user.\"\"\"    setup: Annotated[str, ..., \"The setup of the joke\"]    # Alternatively, we could have specified setup as:    # setup: str                    # no default, no description    # setup: Annotated[str, ...]    # no default, no description    # setup: Annotated[str, \"foo\"]  # default, no description    punchline: Annotated[str, ..., \"The punchline of the joke\"]    rating: Annotated[Optional[int], None, \"How funny the joke is, from 1 to 10\"]structured_llm = llm.with_structured_output(Joke)structured_llm.invoke(\"Tell me a joke about cats\"){\\'setup\\': \\'Why was the cat sitting on the computer?\\', \\'punchline\\': \\'Because it wanted to keep an eye on the mouse!\\', \\'rating\\': 7}Equivalently, we can pass in a JSON Schema dict. This requires no imports or classes and makes it very clear exactly how each parameter is documented, at the cost of being a bit more verbose.json_schema = {    \"title\": \"joke\",    \"description\": \"Joke to tell user.\",    \"type\": \"object\",    \"properties\": {        \"setup\": {            \"type\": \"string\",            \"description\": \"The setup of the joke\",        },        \"punchline\": {            \"type\": \"string\",            \"description\": \"The punchline to the joke\",        },        \"rating\": {            \"type\": \"integer\",            \"description\": \"How funny the joke is, from 1 to 10\",            \"default\": None,        },    },    \"required\": [\"setup\", \"punchline\"],}structured_llm = llm.with_structured_output(json_schema)structured_llm.invoke(\"Tell me a joke about cats\"){\\'setup\\': \\'Why was the cat sitting on the computer?\\', \\'punchline\\': \\'Because it wanted to keep an eye on the mouse!\\', \\'rating\\': 7}Choosing between multiple schemas\\u200bThe simplest way to let the model choose from multiple schemas is to create a parent schema that has a Union-typed attribute:from typing import Union# Pydanticclass Joke(BaseModel):    \"\"\"Joke to tell user.\"\"\"    setup: str = Field(description=\"The setup of the joke\")    punchline: str = Field(description=\"The punchline to the joke\")    rating: Optional[int] = Field(        default=None, description=\"How funny the joke is, from 1 to 10\"    )class ConversationalResponse(BaseModel):    \"\"\"Respond in a conversational manner. Be kind and helpful.\"\"\"    response: str = Field(description=\"A conversational response to the user\\'s query\")class Response(BaseModel):    output: Union[Joke, ConversationalResponse]structured_llm = llm.with_structured_output(Response)structured_llm.invoke(\"Tell me a joke about cats\")Response(output=Joke(setup=\\'Why was the cat sitting on the computer?\\', punchline=\\'To keep an eye on the mouse!\\', rating=8))structured_llm.invoke(\"How are you today?\")Response(output=ConversationalResponse(response=\"I\\'m just a digital assistant, so I don\\'t have feelings, but I\\'m here and ready to help you.

How can I assist you today?\"))Alternatively, you can use tool calling directly to allow the model to choose between options, if your chosen model supports it. This involves a bit more parsing and setup but in some instances leads to better performance because you don\\'t have to use nested schemas. See this how-to guide for more details.Streaming\\u200bWe can stream outputs from our structured model when the output type is a dict (i.e., when the schema is specified as a TypedDict class or  JSON Schema dict). infoNote that what\\'s yielded is already aggregated chunks, not deltas.from typing_extensions import Annotated, TypedDict# TypedDictclass Joke(TypedDict):    \"\"\"Joke to tell user.\"\"\"    setup: Annotated[str, ..., \"The setup of the joke\"]    punchline: Annotated[str, ..., \"The punchline of the joke\"]    rating: Annotated[Optional[int], None, \"How funny the joke is, from 1 to 10\"]structured_llm = llm.with_structured_output(Joke)for chunk in structured_llm.stream(\"Tell me a joke about cats\"):    print(chunk){}{\\'setup\\': \\'\\'}{\\'setup\\': \\'Why\\'}{\\'setup\\': \\'Why was\\'}{\\'setup\\': \\'Why was the\\'}{\\'setup\\': \\'Why was the cat\\'}{\\'setup\\': \\'Why was the cat sitting\\'}{\\'setup\\': \\'Why was the cat sitting on\\'}{\\'setup\\': \\'Why was the cat sitting on the\\'}{\\'setup\\': \\'Why was the cat sitting on the computer\\'}{\\'setup\\': \\'Why was the cat sitting on the computer?\\'}{\\'setup\\': \\'Why was the cat sitting on the computer?\\', \\'punchline\\': \\'\\'}{\\'setup\\': \\'Why was the cat sitting on the computer?\\', \\'punchline\\': \\'Because\\'}{\\'setup\\': \\'Why was the cat sitting on the computer?\\', \\'punchline\\': \\'Because it\\'}{\\'setup\\': \\'Why was the cat sitting on the computer?\\', \\'punchline\\': \\'Because it wanted\\'}{\\'setup\\': \\'Why was the cat sitting on the computer?\\', \\'punchline\\': \\'Because it wanted to\\'}{\\'setup\\': \\'Why was the cat sitting on the computer?\\', \\'punchline\\': \\'Because it wanted to keep\\'}{\\'setup\\': \\'Why was the cat sitting on the computer?\\', \\'punchline\\': \\'Because it wanted to keep an\\'}{\\'setup\\': \\'Why was the cat sitting on the computer?\\', \\'punchline\\': \\'Because it wanted to keep an eye\\'}{\\'setup\\': \\'Why was the cat sitting on the computer?\\', \\'punchline\\': \\'Because it wanted to keep an eye on\\'}{\\'setup\\': \\'Why was the cat sitting on the computer?\\', \\'punchline\\': \\'Because it wanted to keep an eye on the\\'}{\\'setup\\': \\'Why was the cat sitting on the computer?\\', \\'punchline\\': \\'Because it wanted to keep an eye on the mouse\\'}{\\'setup\\': \\'Why was the cat sitting on the computer?\\', \\'punchline\\': \\'Because it wanted to keep an eye on the mouse!\\'}{\\'setup\\': \\'Why was the cat sitting on the computer?\\', \\'punchline\\': \\'Because it wanted to keep an eye on the mouse!\\', \\'rating\\': 7}Few-shot prompting\\u200bFor more complex schemas it\\'s very useful to add few-shot examples to the prompt. This can be done in a few ways.The simplest and most universal way is to add examples to a system message in the prompt:from langchain_core.prompts import ChatPromptTemplatesystem = \"\"\"You are a hilarious comedian. Your specialty is knock-knock jokes. \\\\Return a joke which has the setup (the response to \"Who\\'s there?\") and the final punchline (the response to \"<setup> who?\").Here are some examples of jokes:example_user: Tell me a joke about planesexample_assistant: {{\"setup\": \"Why don\\'t planes ever get tired?\", \"punchline\": \"Because they have rest wings!\", \"rating\": 2}}example_user: Tell me another joke about planesexample_assistant: {{\"setup\": \"Cargo\", \"punchline\": \"Cargo \\'vroom vroom\\', but planes go \\'zoom zoom\\'!\", \"rating\": 10}}example_user: Now about caterpillarsexample_assistant: {{\"setup\": \"Caterpillar\", \"punchline\": \"Caterpillar really slow, but watch me turn into a butterfly and steal the show!\", \"rating\": 5}}\"\"\"prompt = ChatPromptTemplate.from_messages([(\"system\", system), (\"human\", \"{input}\")])few_shot_structured_llm = prompt | structured_llmfew_shot_structured_llm.invoke(\"what\\'s something funny about'),\n",

This changes the output format to contain the raw message output, the parsed value (if successful), and any resulting errors:structured_llm = llm.with_structured_output(Joke, include_raw=True)structured_llm.invoke(\"Tell me a joke about cats\"){\\'raw\\': AIMessage(content=\\'\\', additional_kwargs={\\'tool_calls\\': [{\\'id\\': \\'call_f25ZRmh8u5vHlOWfTUw8sJFZ\\', \\'function\\': {\\'arguments\\': \\'{\"setup\":\"Why was the cat sitting on the computer?\",\"punchline\":\"Because it wanted to keep an eye on the mouse!\",\"rating\":7}\\', \\'name\\': \\'Joke\\'}, \\'type\\': \\'function\\'}]}, response_metadata={\\'token_usage\\': {\\'completion_tokens\\': 33, \\'prompt_tokens\\': 93, \\'total_tokens\\': 126}, \\'model_name\\': \\'gpt-4o-2024-05-13\\', \\'system_fingerprint\\': \\'fp_4e2b2da518\\', \\'finish_reason\\': \\'stop\\', \\'logprobs\\': None}, id=\\'run-d880d7e2-df08-4e9e-ad92-dfc29f2fd52f-0\\', tool_calls=[{\\'name\\': \\'Joke\\', \\'args\\': {\\'setup\\': \\'Why was the cat sitting on the computer?\\', \\'punchline\\': \\'Because it wanted to keep an eye on the mouse!\\', \\'rating\\': 7}, \\'id\\': \\'call_f25ZRmh8u5vHlOWfTUw8sJFZ\\', \\'type\\': \\'tool_call\\'}], usage_metadata={\\'input_tokens\\': 93, \\'output_tokens\\': 33, \\'total_tokens\\': 126}), \\'parsed\\': {\\'setup\\': \\'Why was the cat sitting on the computer?\\',  \\'punchline\\': \\'Because it wanted to keep an eye on the mouse!\\',  \\'rating\\': 7}, \\'parsing_error\\': None}Prompting and parsing model outputs directly\\u200bNot all models support .with_structured_output(), since not all models have tool calling or JSON mode support. For such models you\\'ll need to directly prompt the model to use a specific format, and use an output parser to extract the structured response from the raw model output.Using PydanticOutputParser\\u200bThe following example uses the built-in PydanticOutputParser to parse the output of a chat model prompted to match the given Pydantic schema. Note that we are adding format_instructions directly to the prompt from a method on the parser:from typing import Listfrom langchain_core.output_parsers import PydanticOutputParserfrom langchain_core.prompts import ChatPromptTemplatefrom langchain_core.pydantic_v1 import BaseModel, Fieldclass Person(BaseModel):    \"\"\"Information about a person.\"\"\"    name: str = Field(..., description=\"The name of the person\")    height_in_meters: float = Field(        ..., description=\"The height of the person expressed in meters.\"    )class People(BaseModel):    \"\"\"Identifying information about all people in a text.\"\"\"    people: List[Person]# Set up a parserparser = PydanticOutputParser(pydantic_object=People)# Promptprompt = ChatPromptTemplate.from_messages(    [        (            \"system\",            \"Answer the user query. Wrap the output in `json` tags\\\\n{format_instructions}\",        ),        (\"human\", \"{query}\"),    ]).partial(format_instructions=parser.get_format_instructions())API Reference:PydanticOutputParser | ChatPromptTemplateLet’s take a look at what information is sent to the model:query = \"Anna is 23 years old and she is 6 feet tall\"print(prompt.invoke(query).to_string())System: Answer the user query. Wrap the output in `json` tagsThe output should be formatted as a JSON instance that conforms to the JSON schema below.As an example, for the schema {\"properties\": {\"foo\": {\"title\": \"Foo\", \"description\": \"a list of strings\", \"type\": \"array\", \"items\": {\"type\": \"string\"}}}, \"required\": [\"foo\"]}the object {\"foo\": [\"bar\", \"baz\"]} is a well-formatted instance of the schema. The object {\"properties\": {\"foo\": [\"bar\", \"baz\"]}} is not well-formatted.Here is the output schema:{\"description\": \"Identifying information about all people in a text.\", \"properties\": {\"people\": {\"title\": \"People\", \"type\": \"array\", \"items\": {\"$ref\": \"#/definitions/Person\"}}}, \"required\": [\"people\"], \"definitions\": {\"Person\": {\"title\": \"Person\",'),\n",

One common use-case is extracting data from text to insert into a database or use with some other downstream system. This guide covers a few strategies for getting structured outputs from a model.The .with_structured_output() method\\u200bSupported modelsYou can find a list of models that support this method here.This is the easiest and most reliable way to get structured outputs. with_structured_output() is implemented for models that provide native APIs for structuring outputs, like tool/function calling or JSON mode, and makes use of these capabilities under the hood.This method takes a schema as input which specifies the names, types, and descriptions of the desired output attributes. The method returns a model-like Runnable, except that instead of outputting strings or Messages it outputs objects'),\n",
